            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For although ſhee loue not ſinne yet ſhee will be alwayes where wicked neſſe is? yea, alſo full of ſtrength like a Lyon which will not be tamed.</p>
                     <p>Hee that made the windes, commanded them, and they obey his voyce, the windes and the waters obey him, but man will not obey him. Hee ſaith not that a winde aroſe, but ſaith, The Lord ſent great winde. Therefore we ſee the cauſe of this tempeſt, and ſo of <hi>Ionahs</hi> puniſhment. The iuſt Iudge of the whole world may not ſuffer ſinne vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:3"/> therefore hee ſends, the Lord ſent out a mightie winde. Then it was not by chance, nor yet by witchcraft: for the Mariners (notwithſtanding they were infidels) were not ſo groſſe as to aſcribe it to any ſuch cauſe, but rather thought it to bee ſent from ſome reuenging power, beeing prouoked to indignation by ſome particular perſon among <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 25 <hi>to</hi> 31</note> them, that had committed ſome hainous fact: elſe why did they caſt lots to know him and find him out that had ſinned, and whoſe ſinnes did procure this tempeſt to bee ſent: Though this winde had almoſt drowned <hi>Ionah,</hi> yet hee ſaid, The Lord ſent it: ſo the Lord ſendeth wind to bring ſhips to land in ſafetie, and the ſame Lord ſendeth winde to drowne, and breake, and ſinke other ſhips, Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid when hee was bereft of all his ſubſtance at <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 21.</note> once, and left as poore as might bee, that the Lord had ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken them from him, who had firſt giuen all to him, adding alſo thankſgiuing euen for the perſecuting hand of God, which did ſo moleſt him. If ſome had ſo much loſſe by tempeſt as <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſuch dangers as <hi>Ionah,</hi> they would ſure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſay with <hi>Iob, bleſſed bee the name of the Lord for it:</hi> But <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 9.</note> moe (it is to be feared) would ſay with <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, Curle God and die.</p>
                     <q>And there was a great tempeſt in the Sea.</q>
                     <p>Firſt, God ſpake gently to him, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> Ionah, <hi>goe to Ni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niuie,</hi> then he would not goe: but ſeeing wordes would not ſerue, the Lord would take another way, and try whether that could make him obedient to his voyce. So the Lord cauſed a mightie tempeſt to ariſe in the Sea, like the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers that were ſent to compell folkes to come to the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, that ſeeing the commaundement could not, the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peſt might beare rule. For vnleſſe it be an imperious croſſe wee will not yeeld: ſo head-ſtrong is ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is ſaid, that God ſent out a great winde, ſo that there was a mighty tempeſt, that ſinne might haue the foile, and God the victorie.</p>
                     <p>Hee that ſayles to <hi>Tharſhiſh,</hi> or whether hee is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="tcp:25609:3"/> to goe, would haue as good wind as hee that ſayles to Niniuie, or whither hee is commanded to goe. But he that doth one thing for another, ſhall receiue one thing for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as <hi>Achab</hi> did, who hoped according to the ſaying of foure hundred falſe Prophets, to goe vp and proſper but hee went vp and periſhed. As ſurely as <hi>Ionah</hi> thought to arriue at Tarſhiſh, ſo ſurely the Spaniards thought to arriue in <hi>England:</hi> but as <hi>Ionahs</hi> companie wondred at this tempeſt, ſo at theſe Spainards deſtruction, their fellowes at home wondred, yea were aſtonied, how their inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power could bee deſtroyed. But God is ſtrong enough for them that kicke againſt him, and diſdaineth to bee croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of duſt and aſhes.</p>
                     <q>And there was a great tempeſt in the ſea.</q>
                     <p>The ſhip went on roundly for a time, the Prophet ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the Mariners ſporting, their ſayles flaunting, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters calming, the winds guiding, ſo merrily ſinne goes on before the tempeſt comes. The winde blowes not yet, therefore goe on yet a little, and yet a little more, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the tempeſt ruſhes vpon them before they are aware of it, and tumbles them vp and downe, and ſuddenly all is like to be vndone. Hee came to the hauen, and paide the fare, and entred the ſhip, and hoiſt vp ſayles, and went on forward, and all to flie from God, but now it appeares hee fled not from him, but to him, Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth, If I take the mornings wings and flie aloft, loe, thou art there. If I goe into the neithermoſt depth, thy hande will finde me out: therefore whither ſhall I flye from thee? So that when we thinke that we flie from God, in running out of one place into another, wee doe but runne from one hand to the other, for there is no place where Gods hande is not, and whither ſoeuer a rebellious ſinner doth runne, the hand of God will meete with him to croſſe him, and hinder his hoped fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſucceſſe, although hee ſecurely prophecieth neuer ſo much good vnto himſelfe in his iourney. What had hee offended the windes, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:4"/> that they bare him ſuch enmitie? The windes and the waters, and all Gods creatures are to take Gods part againſt <hi>Ionah,</hi> or any rebellious ſinner: for though God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning gaue power to man ouer all his creatures to rule them, yet when man ſinnes, God giueth power &amp; ſtrength to his creatures to rule and bridle man. Therefore hee that euen now was Lord ouer the waters, now the waters are Lords ouer him.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Ionah</hi> had thought that God would haue brought things to paſſe, he durſt not haue beene ſo bold in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Therefore wee may ſee that ſinne hath no eyes while it is on doing, Tuſh (ſayth the ſoole) it is faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, while he goeth to the ſtockes.</p>
                     <q>So that the ſhip was like to be broken.</q>
                     <p>Wee haue heard of the cauſe and greatneſſe of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, the effects follow, whereby the greatneſſe of it is the better expreſt. Firſt in the ſhip, then in the Mariners.</p>
                     <q>The ſhip was like to be broken.</q>
                     <p>The ſhip was faire and goodly, ſo ſtrong that it might haue encountred with inſtruments of warre, and ſo ſure made that it might haue endured great tempeſtes, and made manie voyages. Yet now with one tempeſt, and at one voyage, it was ſo deformed, ſo weakned, in ſuch a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that it was like to bee ſhiuered in pieces: and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Ionah</hi> was in it. Such ſtrife is alwayes betwixt Gods wrath, and mans diſobedience. When Gods word will not turne vs, Gods winds, and other inſtruments of his wrath <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pro</hi> 7. 22.</note> muſt threaten to ouerturne vs.</p>
                     <q>Then the Mariners were afraid, and cryed euery man to his God, and caſt the wares out that were in the Ship, to lighten it thereof.</q>
                     <p>The effects of this tempeſt in the Mariners were two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they were afraid, then vſed meanes to appeaſe the tempeſt, and ſaue themſelues.</p>
                     <q>Then the Mariners were afraid.</q>
                     <p>Mariners liuing in the Sea, almoſt as fiſhes, hauing the

                     <p>Now theſe nought-fearing fellowes, theſe high ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, which deſire danger are brought downe by danger, feare and quake like a yong ſouldier which ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the ſound of a Gun.</p>

                     <p>The meanes which the Mariners vſe to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are diuers.

<pb facs="tcp:25609:5"/> is a God. Yea his mightie power the blinded Gentiles ſaw ſo expreſſely in all the creatures, that they imagined it to bee impoſſible for one God to worke them all: therefore they thought that there were diuers Gods, as there were diuers ſeaſons, diuers nations, diuers trades, diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, diuers and ſundrie kindes of all things: and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers nations worſhipped diuers Gods, When the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſee that all their inuentions will not bring their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes to paſſe according to their mind, but they are in extremitie and like to bee caſt away for want of ſuccour, then they flye vnto God, being driuen by compulſion as a beare vnto a ſtake, and they crouch and kneele, &amp; make great ſhewes outwardly, of humiliation and pietie, all in hope of helpe from God, and as it were thinking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him by their hypocriſie,</p>

                     <p>This ſheweth, that they were of diuers nations, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles euery nation had a ſeuerall God to worſhip, <hi>Chamos</hi> was the God of the Moabites, and <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the God of the Ekronites, <hi>Dagon</hi> the God of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſtines, and the Epheſians worſhipped <hi>Diana.</hi> In our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 35.</note> wee flie euerie one vnto his God: that is, in the time of neceſſitie euery one doth flye for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> helpe and eaſe vnto that which moſt feedeth his owne humour, or beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, that wherein he repoſeth moſt confidence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelues of ſufficient reliefe from that: ſome runne to their coffers, thinking that there it is that is able to procure eaſe from any troubles: other ſome runne to their delights and wanton ſports, ſuppoſing that there is no trouble ſo great, but they will cauſe them to forget it: ſome to their glorious attires and coſtly iewels, imagining they will now as well reioyce their hearts, remedying their griefe, as at other times they haue delighted others eyes, pleaſing their ſight: ſome to th daintie meates and ſome to their ſoft beds, and eaſie ſtanding, hoping by thoſe to feele reliefe.

                     <q>And cryed euery man vnto his God.</q>
                     <p>They did well in that they prayed, but they prayed not well? for they prayed every man vnto his God: that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fained Gods, gods in name, but not in nature, and gods they were that could not helpe ſo much as themſelues.</p>
                     <q>Euery one to his God,</q>
                     <p>Euerie of theſe mariners did now in their extremitie call vpon his God, euery one vpon that God, which hee thought moſt highly of, and whome hee had in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie repoſed moſt confidence in. Now while none could helpe but one, they cried to many, and by this meanes while they ſought to lay the tempeſt, they ſtirred it more: for their prayers being idolatrous, were ſo wicked, that the Lord had vtterly deſtroyd them, if his mercy had not bene wonderfull ouer all his workes. They prayed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal</hi> 14 4 15.</note> much like the Papiſts, which in extremitie crie out, ſome to one Saint, ſome to another, ſome to ſaints of this place others to Saints of that place, thinking as theſe Mariners did, if one will not helpe, another will.</p>
                     <q>They cryed. &amp;c.</q>
                     <p>They prayed, and their prayers did beate the skye, though they could not lay the tempeſt.

                     <q>They cryed.</q>
                     <p>Here is a diſtinction of crying to bee obſerued: The

And therefore bleſſed is hee that hath the Lord for his God: and let them know that cry without faith, without confidence in God, they doe but cry in vaine.

                     <p>Now wee might aske <hi>Ionah,</hi> ſaying, Why didſt thou write that thou fledſt from God, or that when thou hadſt moſt neede to pray, thou didſt ſleepe? If thou hadſt not thus layed open thine owne ſhame, thou mighteſt haue beene reckoned as one of the beſt Prophetes: therefore why didſt thou ſo? <hi>Ionah</hi> did it to this end, that in him we may ſee the reward of diſobedience: for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, Whatſoeuer is written, is written for our inſtruction: and <hi>Ionah</hi> would neuer haue written it had it not beene for our ſakes.

                     <p>After that the ſhip-maſter had wakened <hi>Ionah</hi> hee bids him call vpon his God, as if hee had ſaid, Watch and pray: hee ſpeakes like a Saint, yet hee is an Infidell he ſaid not, Call vpon our gods: but call vpon thy God. The ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter would not call vpon his God: but (ſaith he) Call vp on thy God and it may be he will helpe vs if hee had ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:25609:11"/> Call vpon our God, when he ſaid, call vpon thy God: and if he had ſaid, He will helpe vs, when he ſaide, if ſo hee will helpe vs then hee had ſhewed ſome ſparke of faith. Becauſe he wanted helpe &amp; comfort, he bids him ariſe, and becauſe he was fearefull, hee bids him pray. It may be (ſaith he) he will think vpon vs, that we periſh not. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Ionah,</hi> we know that thou haſt a God as well as wee, and therefore we ſay, Call vpon thy God, for now euerie God is to bee tried, therefore if euer thou didſt pray in thy life fall to it now. Thus Sathan leades men a blind way with zeale, in hope of ſome reliefe being in trouble. They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon them for helpe, which were neither willing to aſſiſt them, nor able to heare them, and when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by woefull experience, that there was no kind of ſuccour to bee had that way, they flie to God, and then Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than laboureth to vndermine that confidence and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of helpe, and to place in ſtead thereof doubtfulneſſe and infidelitie. Thus Sathan will be ſure to loſe nothing by this bargaine any way. <hi>Ionah</hi> (ſay they) call vpon thy God, for if hee cannot helpe vs, we are all vndone and loſt for wee haue called vpon all our gods, we haue laboured hard to amend our ſtate, wee haue caſt away our goods to lighten the ſhip, but all in vaine, for wee are now! it the better, like the woman which had ſpent all her ſubſtance <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke.</hi> 8. 43.</note> about Phyſicke, yet all could not helpe her till Chriſt came. So the Papiſtes while they are well, they pray not euery Saint and Angell for ſuccour againſt the troubleſome times, but in extremitie, or at the point of death none of them can helpe, ſo that then they are faine to flye vnto God or bee deſtitute, as like Idolaters, as one flye is like another: they are like the heathen, which worſhip <hi>Iuno, Venus, Neptune, Pallas, Iupiter,</hi> and the reſt: ſome hold on the one, and ſome on the other. Some ſay, If <hi>Iohn</hi> bee with mee, I care not for all the pettie gods becauſe I holde him chiefe: ſo another ſaith, If Saint <hi>Gabriel</hi> bee with mee, I care not for the reſt: and ſome
<pb facs="tcp:25609:11"/> raiſe great diſputations, whether this Saint or that Saint, this Angell or that Angell be better: whether our Ladie of Bullen, or our Lady of Rome bee ſureſt: whether Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of Callis, or Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of Compoſtella bee ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: and ſo like beggers which run from doore to doore, they run from one Saint to another. If one God will not helpe, another will, thinke theſe, as though the Gods were contrarie one to another, and where the one bids the other forbids. So ſome thought that <hi>Venus</hi> was a friend to the Troianes, and <hi>Pallas</hi> was not their friend; as fooles thinke of Witches, one ſtrikes, another heales.</p>
                     <q>Call vpon thy God.</q>
                     <p>They bid him call vpon his God, before they knewe him <note place="margin">Infidels de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire the faith full to pray for them.</note> but the faithfull would not worſhip a falſe God, though they may bee helped by him. By the example of theſe mariners, if they thought that their God was the true God (&amp; why els did they worſhip him:) we may learne the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of euery temptation that doth vndermine vs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it will bid vs doe this euill, that good may come <note place="margin">Sin alwaies promiſeth, good.</note> of it: Marke whenſoeuer thou art motioned to euill, if it doe not promiſe thee ſome goodneſſe to come of it. But the ſeruants of God ought not to doe that which is euill, though they were ſure to gaine all things that can bee wiſhed by ſo doing: for they haue learned their leſſon, and how to anſwere Sathan at ſuch times: Why tempteſt thou me, Sathan? for it is written, Thou muſt not doe euill that good may come of it: and this is the armour called <note place="margin">

When they had cryed &amp; ſaw no helpe, they diſtruſted their Gods, they thought they would not helpe: indeede they could not: therefore they ran to another whom they knew not, hoping to bee helped by him, becauſe they thought ſome God there was that could doe it. So the Papiſts run from one God to another, from <hi>S. Dominick</hi> to <hi>S. Francis:</hi> and why ſhould they run from <hi>S. Dominick</hi> to <hi>S.

And now might <hi>Ionah</hi> ſay, Beware by mee, for thus hath the tempter deceiued me, he hath allured mee with flattring fantaſies, and perſwaded me, that it was but an eaſie thing to flie from the preſence of the Lord, that ſeeth alwayes all things, and from whom no man, no nor ſecret lurking in any mans heart can be hid, but all are alwaies in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Hee made me beleeue that light could bee brought out of darkneſſe, that good may come of euill? for he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth mee, that if I would ſet forth toward <hi>Tharſhiſh:</hi> I ſhould not onely ſhun the preſence of the Lord, but ſhould liue at eaſe like one vnknowne, both for my vocation, and alſo for my behauiour in the execution thereof, and ſo I might creepe into a familiaritie with theſe people, and enioy the benefite of thy ſocietie. Otherwiſe if I went to <hi>Niniuie</hi> as the Lord commanded, they would hate and perſecute mee, yea, and ſo I ſhould end my life in miſerie, both becauſe they being Gentiles, and I a Iewe, they cannot abide mee, for the one holdeth the other in contempt: and alſo becauſe of my meſſage, namely, a prophecie of deſtruction, grounded vpon a reproofe of their vile and ſinfull pleaſures, Which meſſage, Sathan perſwaded mee, would be ſo hainouſly taken, that no death nor torment that they could deuiſe for mee, would bee thought ſufficient, and ſo I ſhould bee ſure neuer to eſcape their hands aliue if I went: as though the eternall and moſt glorious God, which ſent me thither, were not able to defend mee from all euill when I came thither, as well as hee did <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lyons, and Chriſt in the wilderneſſe among the ſauage beaſtes.

                     <q>They caſt lots.</q>
                     <p>But firſt, they conſult and conſent to caſt lots. The tempeſt was ſo ſtrong that they concluded with themſelues, it was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging power of ſome angrie God, for the ſinne of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notorious wretch that was amongeſt them.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore neither they, nor <hi>Ionah</hi> praying had appeaſed the tempeſt, but it was rather increaſed, and no man confeſſed hee was that ſinner, they take counſell, and agree to find him out by lots Wherein let vs obſerue firſt, neuer a one of them is of <hi>Dauids</hi> ſpirit, who when he ſaw the people plagued, ſaid, Lord it is I: Euery man excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb facs="tcp:25609:14"/> himſelfe: for euery man would extenuate his owne ſinne, and diminiſh it, and euery one thinketh his ſinne ſalued, when he hath excuſed himſelfe. Let <hi>Adam</hi> bee his owne iudge and hee will ſay, The woman tempted him to ſinne: and let the woman be her owne iudge, and ſhe will ſay, Yonder Serpent perſwaded her to it. Let euery one be his owne iudge, and there will be ſuch poſting off of ſinne, that neuer a one will be found guiltie. There is none that will bee ſo impudent as to ſay he hath no ſinne at all, yet fewe that will freely confeſſe they haue greiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinned. Therefore theſe here ſay euery man within himſelfe, though he be a ſinner, yet hee is no great ſinner. None are accounted ſinners, vnleſſe they bee openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected of ſome notable and hainous crime. If they bee Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſwearers, drunkards, brawlers, pickers, flatterers, pro phaners of the Saboath, ſleepers at Church, and ſuch like, they be not thought ſinners: theſe actions are counted no ſins, but rather recreations. For the multitude count none ſinners, vnleſſe they be theeues, traitors, open and groſſe Idolaters, and taken with ſuch like capitall crimes: no nor theſe neither, were it not for feare of the law: as none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, but Publicans, were counted ſinners, all the reſt were good fellowes, and iuſt men.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts ſay, Some thoughts, affections, words, and outward actions, not agreeing with the Law of God, are eaſily waſht away with a little holy-water, &amp;c. they are not deadly, they deſerue not the wrath of God, they are but veniall. Did you euer read of theſe veniall ſinnes in the Scripture? But thinke you they haue nothing but Scripture? Yes, they haue Decrees, they haue decretals, the Ceremonies whereof obſerued, theſe veniall ſinnes are ſoone pardoned, and they haue a Pope that can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue any ſinnes. Thus they leſſon ſinnes, thus they abate the price of ſinnes, and they can buy our ſinnes with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or redeeme them with Maſſes, and by a little ſhorte penance, purchaſe a large and long pardon.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:15"/>
                     <p>And as the Mariners, euery man thought hee was no great ſinner: ſo <hi>Ionah</hi> thought with himſelfe, Though I bee a great ſinner, yet am I not ſo greious a ſinner as theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous heathens: or if hee throughly condemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet vnwilling to be knowne ſuch a rebell, hee thought it may bee, it is moſt likely, they are many, I but one, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture therefore the lot will not fall vpon mee, like a theefe, which notwithſtanding in his owne heart hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelfe guiltie of that wherewithall hee is charged, yet will not confeſſe, vntill the matter bee throughly ſifted, and ſo clearely prooued to his owne face in ſuch ſort, that he cannot for ſhame (though with ſhame he confeſſe,) denie it. Therefore, if God had not ſifted out this ſinner the better, <hi>Ionah</hi> would not haue beene knowne the man, and the Mariners would ſtill haue contended who was the leſſer ſinner, therefore they conſult to caſt lots.</p>
                     <q>Let vs cast lots.</q>
                     <p>They did not vſe to caſt lots, this was no cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Mariners: but the tempeſt was ſo wonderfull, that it made them ſeriouſly to thinke of God, and willing to vſe the meanes preſcribed by god for the ending of doubt full matters, acknowledging that hee ordereth all, and the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pro.</hi> 18. 18 <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 33.</note> lot is the ſentence of God: by the falling of the lot, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth the truth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe like worldlings neuer confeſſe God, but when he commeth in a tempeſt: they will not ſee his mercie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his iuſtice appeare: they will not acknowledge Gods gouernement, before he bring on them ſome iudgement, like <hi>Pharaos</hi> ſorcerers, who confeſſed not Gods Maieſtie, while they liued at eaſe, but when the Lord plagued them, then cried out, This is the finger of God. <note place="margin">

                     <q>Let vs caſt lots, that we may know for whoſe cauſe this euill is come vpon vs.</q>
                     <p>Why? what are they the better when they know him? what would they doe with him on whome the lot ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:25609:15"/> fall? Surely they ſuppoſing, or rather clearely ſeeing this tempeſt to bee ſent from ſome wrathfull power, and that for ſome one mans ſinne amongſt them, they determined hauing found him, to ſacrifice him vnto the God that was ſo offended by him, God turneth euill into good, but the deuill turneth good vnto euill. The Gentiles had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in the time of the common plague, to ſacrifice one for the reſt. This cuſtome they tooke by imitation of the Iewes, in offering beaſts, &amp; of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering his ſon the deuill that father of lyes, and ſchoolemaiſter of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe teaching them. So the deuill tooke aduantage to doe euill by the ſeruice of God, in mouing the Gentiles to worke abhomination, by offering men, imitating the Iewes commaunded ſacrifices, But if they had rightly known the true God, they would haue taken their ſinnes by the throat, and haue ſacrificed them.</p>
                     <q>Come, let vs caſt lots.</q>
                     <p>The mariners were not ſo wiſe to preuent the tempeſt before it came, as they bee diligent to alay the tempeſt when it may not be layd. wee ouertaken with Gods iuſt iudgements, are very carefull alwaies, to vſe all meanes to bee rid of them. But who keepeth a watch of his owne waies, and diligently laboureth to keepe himſelfe free from that which neceſſarily draweth on it ſelfe Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, who purgeth himſelfe of his ſinnes, leaſt he bee ſicke? who letteth or fetcheth out his corrupt bloud, of pride, luſt, couetouſneſſe, leaſt hee be ſore: who keepeth a good dyet, and maketh his choyſe of holy excerciſes, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companions, religious conferences? &amp;c. But knowe wee, hee is not ſafe that is not ſound, neither he ſound that is intemperate.</p>
                     <q>So they caſt lots,</q>
                     <p>Whether it be lawfull to caſt lots, it is not euident by this example, becauſe they were Gentiles, and therefore no preſident for vs: but ſo farre may wee vſe them, as the word doth lead vs, and no further.</p>

                     <p>There are two Goates brought to <hi>Aaron,</hi> that hee might <note place="margin">

                     <p>Againe it is ſaid, that <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen king by lots: and leaſt any ſhould haue ſaid, that it was his good lucke: <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.</note> his good lot or chance to bee King, therefore the Lord appointed that he ſhould be annointed before he was cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen by lots. <note place="margin">

                     <p>Againe <hi>Matthias</hi> is choſen by lots to the Apoſtleſhip in ſtead of <hi>Iudas:</hi> ſo that it is lawfull in ſome cauſes to caſt lots, ſo that they doe attribute nothing vnto them and acknowledge that the lot is caſt into the lap, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereof is from the Lord: for they muſt not ſay that it is their chance, fortune, or good lucke: for ſo they make an Idole of it and rob God of the honour due vnto him. For it was not <hi>Saules</hi> fortune to be King, but Gods mercy: it was not <hi>Achans</hi> chaunce to bee caught, but Gods iudgement. Lots may be vſed to preuent ſtrife, when all other meanes haue beene vſed, and ſometimes before al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, when in wiſedome it is thought the beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> meanes. Brethren often and godly at firſt deuide them inheritance by lots, as the Children of Iſraell deuided the land of Canaan. Therefore in the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> there is an order, that in the time of plague, there ſhould bee a houſe ſet apart for the ſicke to lodge in, and leaſt they ſhould bee vncomforted, they chuſe out a Miniſter by lots to doe it.</p>
                     <q>So they caſt lots,</q>
                     <p>Now wee are come to put vpour ſelues to the Court of Lawyers, to ſee if they will doe any thing for God, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or for loue, <hi>viz</hi> that they would end mens ſuites
<pb facs="tcp:25609:16"/> quickly, and let the poore Clients haue equitie. Some ſay, that Lawyers bee good vntill they bee Counſellers, like Lyons, which will be gentle vntill their tallons grow: bee not offended, but amend, for malice ſpeakes not.</p>
                     <p>I am perſwaded, that if the lots were caſt to ſee who troubles the ſhip, it would fall vpon the Lawyers: be not offended but amend, for malice ſpeakes not. A poore Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent commeth forth accuſing one, and going home accuſeth a hundred: for ſo many ſeeke to gaine by him, ſo few ſeeke to further him, and ſo many ſeeke to hinder him, that all his gaine is but labour and loſſe.</p>
                     <p>For a ſmall matter many will come to law, to ſtriue for that which with reaſon might eaſily bee attained without ſuch contention, and others ſeeke to enrich themſelues with contending for a ſmall matter with their neighbours, yet in the end looſe that they ſought, and that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: and ſo they contend and ſtriue about a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, till the Lawyer hath gayned more by them, then the thing which is in controuerſie is worth. Theſe are like the Mouſe and the Frog, which ſtroue ſo long about Marſh-ground, that at length the Kite came and tooke them both from it. Others will come vp to Law about a ſmall matter, and therein ſo intangle themſelues, that they cannot rid their handes of it, vntill it haue almoſt vndone them like a ſilly ſheepe that is hunting of a flie, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from buſh to buſh, and euery buſh catcheth a locke of him, ſo that the poore ſheepe is threed-bareere hee hath done, and hath not a fleece left him to couer himſelfe withall. So hee runs from Court to Court, to ſue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, to plead, till he haue ſpent his cloke for his coate: were it not better to haue caſt lots for the coate at firſt? for the law is like a Butlers boxe, play ſtill on, till all come to the Candleſticke. Therefore it is lawfull, to end any controuerſie in a hard matter, to vſe this meane.</p>
                     <p>Now whether it be lawfull to caſt dice, if lots may not bee vſed (as <hi>Solomons</hi> wordes, <hi>Prouerbes.</hi> 18. 18. The
<pb facs="tcp:25609:17"/> lot cauſeth contention to ceaſe, compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. proue) but in hard matters and waightie cauſes, when the thing is doubtfull, and all good meanes are tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to auoyd ſtrife: that queſtion is decided, which none <note place="margin">Arguments againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.</note> but voluptuous men make queſtion of, namely, whether dice-play bee a meete exerciſe for a Chriſtian ſoule. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayth, the lot cauſeth contention to ceaſe: therefore, lots are to end ſtrife, but theſe lots make ſtrife: for before thou takeſt the Dice, thou knoweſt thine owne, and no man ſtriueth to take it from thee: but when thou caſteſt the dice, thou doeſt (as it were) aske whether thine owne bee thine owne, and makeſt a ſtrife of no ſtrife. Art thou not worthy to looſe the giftes of God, which ventureſt to looſe them when thou needeſt not? Doeſt thou not deſerue to forget thine owne, which art ſo greedy of anothers, that thou wouldeſt haue his liuing for nothing but for turning of a die? <hi>Eſau</hi> did not ſell his birth right ſo lightly, but he had ſomewhat for it which refreſhed his hunger, but God hath giuen thee a liuing, and thou ſpendeſt it for nothing. The Mariners did caſt lots to finde out the ſinner: they did not caſt dice to ſee who ſhould winne, as Dicers doe: for to whom the lot falles, hee taketh all, which deſerues to looſe all as well'as the other, and hath no right vnto it by any lawe: for God hath not allowed one man to take anothers goods for the tripping of a Die, but eyther they muſt be merited, or they muſt be giuen, or they muſt be bought, or elſe it is vnlawfull, vngodly, vnconſcionable to take them: Beſides the brawles, the coſenages, the othes annexed to this game, which would not agree with it, vnleſſe it had been a meete companion for them. Thou takeſt another mans goods for nothing, whereas God hath appointed thee to get thy liuing with the ſweate of thy browes, for thou takeſt away that which others ſweat for, and whereas thou ſhouldeſt liue by working, thou ſeekeſt to liue by playing, like as the ape which liues by toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Doth any dicer thinke hee doth well? Tell mee what
<pb facs="tcp:25609:17"/> thinkeſt thou? for euery ſinner doth condemne in his prayer to God, that which he excuſeth before men: if they which are gameſters repent it, how can they which are gameſters defend it? Thou ſhouldeſt do nothing, but that thou wouldeſt haue God finde thee doing if hee ſhoulde come to iudgement: wouldeſt thou haue him take thee at dice? I am ſure thou wouldeſt not haue God ſee thee ſo vainely occupied: neither canſt thou thinke, that Chriſt or his prophets, or Apoſtles, or Euangeliſts were Dicers, for no ſuch lots are named in the holy Scripture, and yet the Lords day is moſt prophaned with this exerciſe, cards and dice, as though they kept all their vanities to celebrate holy daies, what haſt thou to alledge for dice, now euidence is giuen vp againſt them? haſt thou any patron to ſpeake for them, but thy vaine pleaſure and filthy couetouſneſſe, which are condemned already, and therefore haue no voyce by lawe? take away theſe, and take away dice. The patron condemnes the clients, when one voice condemnes another: if the exerciſe were lawfull, ſuch patrons as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and couetouſneſſe would not ſpeake for it. Take thy pleaſure therefore in that which is good, and the Angels will reioyce with thee: if this were good, God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper them better that vſe it: but neither winners nor lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers are gainers. I know not how, but there is not ſo much wonne as loſt, as though the Deuill did part ſtakes with them, and drawe away with a blacke hand, when no man ſeeth, for the winner, ſaith he, hath not won halfe ſo much as the loſer hath loſt. One would thinke that ſome of them ſhould flow, when ſo many ebbe: there is neuer an ebbe without a flowing, neuer one looſeth, but another win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but at dice. What a curſed thing is this that turnes no man to good, which robs others, and beggars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? the ſchoole of deceit, the ſhop of oathes, and the field of vanities. Thou doeſt not onely hazard thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (in this game) but ventureſt thy ſaluation, and caſteſt dice with the Deuill, who ſhall haue thy ſoule. For euery
<pb facs="tcp:25609:18"/> thing that commeth well to a man, hee giueth thankes, but for that which commeth by dice, hee is aſhamed to giue thanks: which ſheweth, that in conſcience that gaine is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gotten, and that he ſought it without God. Can this be good when worſt men vſe it moſt? if it were good, the euill would like worſe of it then the good: but the more a man ſauoureth of any goodneſſe, the more hee begins to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it, and his conſcience doth accuſe him for it as for ſin. They which doubt whether God doe allow it, neede but looke how he doth proſper them that vſe it: but they truſt not in God, (the termes of their occupation diſcrie) for they call all their caſts, chances, as though they relyed not vpon God, but vpon chaunce. Therefore if dice make ſtrife without cauſe, if they take away others goods for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if wee may not liue by playing, but by labour, if they which haue beene dicers, repent it among their ſins, if the holy men neuer vſed this recreation, but the worſt moſt delight in it, if thou wouldeſt not haue God ſee thee when thou playeſt at Dice, nor take thee at it when hee comes to iudgement, if nothing but pleaſure and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſpeake for them, if they doe not proſper which take pleaſure in it, if they truſt not vpon God, but relie vpon chaunce, if thou doeſt not onely venture thy money, but hazard thy ſoule, then the beſt caſt at dice is, to caſt them quite away.</p>

Now therefore he muſt needs confeſſe it The winds thundring. the waues tumbling the ſhip crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the mariners quaking, vpon their gods crying, their wares forth caſting, <hi>Ionahs</hi> prayers requeſted, to caſt lots conſulting, <hi>Ionah</hi> kept himſelfe cloſe, hee would not bee thought that ſinner. The wind ſaid I will ouer turne thee: the water ſaid, I will drowne thee: the ſhip ſaid, I cannot hold thee: the mariners ſaid, We cannot helpe thee: his prayers ſaid, Wee cannot profit thee, his conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bleeding, and God at the doore of his heart knocking, and the lots now ready for caſting, ſaid threatningly, For thee the tempeſt is come, thoufugitiue, and wee will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer thee.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Ionah</hi> conceales his ſin, ſo much did heabhorre the ſhame of men, of ſtrange men, a few men, fraile men, or the feare of the furie of the fleſhe, Therefore after the windes had roared, and alſo the waues raged, and the ſhip reeled, and the mariners cryed, and the lot, his conſcience, and God himſelfe threatned him, the lot alſo condemned him, and the feare of being ſacrificed by ſinners to Sathan terrified him, ſo that he foorthwith repented throughly, he declared it openly, and confeſſed his ſinne freely. Such a ſtir hath God before he can come by his owne: hee muſt croſſe vs, and ſet himſelfe and all his creatures againſt vs: hee muſt ſtraine our bodies, or leaue our ſoules, and conſtraine vs to it, before wee will returne from our wicked wayes
<pb facs="tcp:25609:19"/> and throughly humble out ſelues to yeeld him due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. O the goodneſſe of the great God? O long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and bountifulneſſe vnſpeakeable, which not onely leadeth, but alſo in the chaines of loue draweth vs to true repentance?</p>
                     <p>It was Gods great goodneſſe to <hi>Ionah,</hi> that the mariners ſacrificed him not: greater, that hee truly repented: that God continueth in his calling, and bleſſeth his (whoſe fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, deſerued flinging to Sathan) not ſo much ſolemne preaching, as ſudden confeſſion, and ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of vengeance, yea made it ſo powerfull, that it conuerted Idolatrous heathens, moſt hardned Idolaters: firſt Mariners, then Niniuites.</p>
                     <p>For what a bleſsing felt <hi>Ionah,</hi> God vouchſafing him of this honour, to offer them a liuely, holy, &amp; acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, by whome hee preſently before greatly feared to haue bene offered a dead, vnholy, and ſo a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull ſacrifice to Sathan. This feare baniſhed, &amp; that ioy poſſeſsing him, what a merey of the almighty did <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> thinke it? But before he conuerted the Niniuities, he was more to be humbled, fuller to be ſtrengthened, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euery way to bee prepared. Therefore God would haue the ſea to waſh him, the Whale to faſt him, and yet miraculouſly ſafe to preſerue him, that being purified, hee might pray feruently, and being deliuered, finde power, comfort, and courage aboundantly. Therefore when by <note place="margin">

                        <note place="margin">13.</note> himſelfe profeſſed hee knew the tempeſt was ſent for his cauſe, and would be layd he being caſt into the Sea. <hi>Ionah</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">12</note> at length was caſt out of the ſhip into the ſwelling purge of the tempeſtuous ſea. What hope of life then left? is there any? to ſwallow vp all, ſoone after hee is ſwallowed whole of a Whale. Here let vs marke, that after the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
<pb facs="tcp:25609:20"/> had terrified <hi>Ionah,</hi> the mariners reproued him: when they had reproued him, his conſcience pricked him: when his conſcience had pricked him, the conſulting to caſt lots griued him: after greife for conſulting, their concluding to caſt lots vexed him: vexed at their concluſion, the lot condemnes him: the lot hauing condemned him, in what an agonie thinke we was <hi>Ionah?</hi> partly, that he ſhould be held that notorious wretch that had brought this woe? partly, leaſt they in their raging griefe, for their great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of body, loſſe of goods, and danger of life, ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with kill him for a ſacrifice, to appeaſe the vnknowne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God? But after this agonie, the terror of drowning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and after that the horror of the huge fiſh: firſt, leaſt it teare him in pieces, then leaſt it melt him, afterward, leaſt it poiſon him: laſtly, three dayes and three nights the comfortleſſe horror of darkeneſſe, and noyſome ſtincke in the fiſhes belly tormented him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then ſee, the windes could not further him, the waters could not beare him, the ſhip could not hold him, the Mariners could not helpe him: and being caſt out, leaſt all for him be caſt away, the Whale would not ſpare him, the ſtinch would ill feede him, the darkeneſſe would leſſe glad him, and light might not viſit him. Now ſee then what <hi>Ionah</hi> got by this iourney, notwithſtanding all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of which Sathan aſſured him, and all the furtherances which the ſerpent procured him, hee loſt his labour, loſt his money, loſt his ioy, loſt his credit, loſt his quiet, and ſaw no hope but to looſe his life too, finding plentifully, and bitterly feeling dreadfull feares. Hee truſted to the windes, the windes could not ſerue him: hee truſted to the ſhip, the ſhip could not keepe him: he truſted to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, the Mariners could not hold him: hee truſted to the lot, the lot would not ſpare him: hee truſted to the waters, the waters could not beare him, neyther woulde the Whale forbeare him, neither did any thing make ſhew of likelihood to ſaue him. Therefore wee may ſee in <hi>Ionah</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25609:20"/> what it profiteth a man to fly from God, forſaking his calling, and ſo practiſing the euill motions of Sathan in ſtead of the knowne will of God. Aſſuredly, if wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his flatteries as <hi>Ionah</hi> did, wee ſhall haue as he had, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing conſciences, fearefull hearts, and the wrath of God vpon our heads. For hee hath nothing to giue vs, although he promiſe and make vs beleeue he hath great kingdomes. Yes indeed, hee hath horror of mind for all that obey him, and hell for the reward of his, which will make all their hearts ake which receiue it.</p>
                     <p>See ſecondly in this puniſhment of <hi>Ionah,</hi> the iuſtice of God. The Bee, when ſhe hath once ſtung, doth leeſe her ſting, ſo that ſhee can ſting no more: ſo doth not Gods iuſtice puniſhing ſinne: for it retaineth power, it hath ſtore of ſtings to vexe ſtill: when one iudgement is executed, ſhee euer hath other inow ready, either of the ſame kinde, in another degree more ſharpe, or of another ſort: for all the creatures with their ſeuerall powers, are Gods darts to ſtrike vs when he commaunds. Therefore if we be ſicke ſickeneſſe is not dead with vs: if wee bee poore, pouerty en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth not: if wee bee in danger, danger is not therefore put downe for euer after: and if wee bee vexed, vexation hath not therefore left his ſting: his darts, his weapons alſo are as ſharpe now as they were at the firſt, and ſharper too, be cauſe wee are ſinfuller. For according to the ſickneſſe is the medicine, and wounds more dangerous, require more dolourous plaſters.</p>
                     <p>And if thou be diſobedient, then hee will lead thee through them all, vntill he hath humbled thee, and made <note place="margin">Leui. 26 18. 24. 28. 36. 37. 38. 39 &amp;c.</note> thee to glorifie him with obedience, or vtterly deſtroyed thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let vs not forget, neither lightly thinke of this, that God knoweth how to puniſh for ſin, yea moſt ſeuerely to correct his children, though repenting. If our Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> here may not keep thee ſome good while in a due meditation of it, let that man after Gods own hart
<pb facs="tcp:25609:21"/> the ſweete Prophet of Iſraell come to thy minde, and in <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 6 10. 27, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. <hi>chap Pſal.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 75. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 17, <hi>Ie.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>Dan</hi> 6. 22 <hi>Dan.</hi> 3 23. <hi>Num.</hi> 1. 46. <hi>Exo.</hi> 17. 3 <hi>Exo</hi> 16 13. <hi>Io.</hi> 2. 10 <hi>Ie</hi> 38. 13. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 24, <hi>&amp;.</hi> 3 26. <hi>Ex</hi> 17. 6. <hi>Exo</hi> 16 13. <hi>E.</hi> 2. 15. 3. 10.</note> him ſee, whether God cockereth his entireſt friends, or ſomething ſharply, if not bitterly, handleth them, ſetling themſelues in their dregs, or ſecurely ſeruing the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, yet conſider God is rich in mercy, and full of compaſſion, both to puniſh, vnleſſe to far prouoked, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſhake his rod ouer vs, to make vs feare onely, and keepe vs free from feeling his ſtrokes, if that may haue his due worke in vs, that is, recall, reforme, and confirme vs: for as the windes could not ouerthrow <hi>Ionah,</hi> nor the waters drowne him: ſo neither could the whale conſume, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or annoy him, or ought but feare him, though it had ſwallowed him: for <hi>Ionah</hi> remembring God, God ſhewed hee forgot not <hi>Ionah.</hi> Therefore when and where <hi>Ionah</hi> thought verily and ſpeedily to haue periſhed, then and there God cauſed him to bee three dayes, and as many nights moſt ſafely preſerued. O power omnipotent, O goodneſſe all ſufficient, in all things, at all times. God then as well knoweth to deliuer his out of all diſtreſſe in due time, as to reſerue the wicked to the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee puniſhed. And in what danger ſhall wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire?

                     <q>And the lot fell vpon Ionah.</q>
                     <p>The lot fell vpon <hi>Ionah,</hi> that hee might bee caſt out of the ſhip, that as the ſhip was almoſt broken, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo <hi>Ionah</hi> might bee almoſt drowned, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: almoſt conſumed, almoſt poiſoned in the bellie of the whale, but not altogether: and that being in the double deepe duely humbled, and as gold in a furnace, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fit for Gods workes, hee might thence in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner come foorth like <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his winding ſheete, that hee might glorifie God once againe, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly cry againſt Niniuie.</p>
                     <q>And the lot fell vpon Ionah.</q>
                     <p>The lot fallen vpon <hi>Ionah</hi> the iuſtice of God (both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the truth incorruptly, and chaſtiſing his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſeruant ſeuerely) did appeare: but with all ſingular mercie ſhined, and the mariners mindes were mollified, in that they ſacrificed him not to Sathan, but much more, that hee by that meanes truely repented. In ſo much that the old idolatrous mariners preſently by him were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and hee caſt into the Sea, was not drowned; ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of the Whale, and three daies continuing therein, periſhed not, but miraculouſly was preſerued, and moſt graciouſly caſt on land ſafe: and laſtly, crying againſt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuie, that ſinfull Citie, had his preaching ſo mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, that hee wonderfully humbled them all.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I ſhould haue preached vnder the Croſſe, I muſed what text to take in hand to pleaſe all, and to keepe my ſelfe out of danger: and muſing, I could not finde any text in the Scripture that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſin, vnleſſe it were in the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> which is not of the Scripture: this text bids them that be voluptuous be voluptuous ſtill: let them that bee vaine glorious, be vaine glorious ſtill: let them that be couetous,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:26"/> be couetous ſtill: let them that be drunkards, be drunkards ſtill: let them that be ſwearers, be ſwearers ſtill: let them that be wantons, be wantons ſtill: let them that be careleſſe prelates, be careleſſe ſtill: let them that be vſurers, be vſurers ſtill: but ſaith Salomon, <hi>Remember thy end, that thou ſhalt be called to iudgement at the laſt for altogether.</hi> This is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſeſt then liuing: what a counſell is this for a wiſe man, ſuch a one as was <hi>Salomon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning of his booke he ſaith, <hi>All is vanitie,</hi> and in the end he ſaith, <hi>Feare God and keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:</hi> in the 12. Chapter he ſaith, <hi>Remember thy maker in the dayes of thy youth:</hi> But here hee ſaith, <hi>Reioyce, O yong man, in thy youth.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh like an Epicure, which ſayth, Eate, drinke, and bee merry: heere hee counſeles, and heere hee mockes: yet not after the manner of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, although they deſerued it in ſhewing their fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as it is in the firſt of the Prouerbes, <hi>Hee laughed at the wicked in deriſion,</hi> as in the ſecond Pſalme, God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs follow our owne wayes. For when he bids vs pray, wee play: and when he bids vs runne, wee ſtand ſtill: and when he bids vs faſt, wee feaſt, and ſend for vanities to make vs ſport: then hee laughs at our deſtruction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Salomon</hi> giueth a ſharpe reproofe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you aſhamed in a word, hee ſcoffingly bids you doe it againe, like a Schoolemaiſter which beateth his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for playing the truant, hee biddeth him play the truant againe. O this is the bittereſt reproofe of all. But leaſt any Libertine ſhould miſconſter <hi>Salomon,</hi> and ſay that hee bids vs be merry and make much of our ſelues, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhutteth vp with a watchword, and ſetteth a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle before his lips, and reprooueth it as he ſpeaketh it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee goeth any further, and ſayth, <hi>But remember that for all theſe things thou muſt come to iudgement.</hi> But if we will vnderſtand his meaning, hee meaneth when hee ſaith Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, O young man, Repent, O young man, in thy youth; and when hee ſaith, Let thy heart cheare thee, Let
<pb facs="tcp:25609:26"/> thy ſinnes greiue thee: for hee meaneth otherwiſe then he ſpeaketh: hee ſpeaketh like <hi>Michai</hi> in the booke of Kings the ſecond Chapter. <hi>Goe vp and proſper:</hi> or like as <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Goe vp and ſerue other Gods:</hi> or as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in the Reuelation, <hi>Let them that be wicked, bee wickea ſtill</hi> But if there were no iudgement day, that were a merry world: therefore ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> when thou art in thy pleaſures flaunting in the fields, and in thy braue ruffes, and amongſt thy Louers, with thy ſmiling lookes, thy wanton talke and merry ieſtes, with thy pleaſant games and loftie lookes, <hi>Remember for all theſe things thou ſhalt come to iudgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whileſt the theefe ſtealeth, the hempe groweth, and the hooke is couered within the baite: wee ſit downe to eate, and riſe vp to play, and from play to ſleepe, and a hundred yeares is counted little enough to ſinne in: but how many ſinnes thou haſt ſet on the ſcore, ſo many kinds of puniſhments ſhall bee prouided for thee. Howe many yeeres of pleaſure thou haſt taken, ſo many yeeres of paine: how many drammes of delight, ſo many pounds of dolour: when iniqui tie hath plaid her part, vengance leapes vpon the ſtage, the Comedie is ſhort, but the Tragedie is longer: the blacke gard ſhall attend vpon you, you ſhall eate at the table of ſorrow, and the crowne of death ſhall bee vpon your heads, many gliſtring faces looking on you, and this is the feare of ſinners: when the deuill hath entiſed them to ſinne, hee preſumeth like the old Prophet in the booke of kings, who when he had entiſed the yong Prophet contrarie to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to turne home with him, and to eate and drinke, he curſed him for his labour, becauſe he diſobeyed the commaundement of the Lord, and ſo as a Lyon deuou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red him by the way. The fooliſh virgins thinke that their oyle will neuer bee ſpent: ſo <hi>Dina</hi> ſtragled abroad, whileſt ſhee was defloured: what a thing is this to ſay Reioyce, &amp; then Repent? what a blanke to ſay. Take thy pleaſure,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:27"/> &amp; then thou ſhalt come to iudgement? It is as if he ſhould ſay, Steale and be hanged, ſteale and thou dareſt, ſtrangle ſin the cradle, for all the wiſdome in the world will not helpe thee elſe: but thou ſhalt be in admiration like drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers which dreame ſtrange things, and knowe not how they come, He ſaith, <hi>Remember iudgement.</hi> If thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alwaies, then thou ſhalt haue little liſt to ſin: if thou remember this, then thou ſahtl haue little liſt to fall downe to the deuill, though hee would giue thee all the world, and the glorie thereof. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, The weede groweth from a weede to a cockle, from a cockle to a bram<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, from a bramble to a brier, from a brier to a thorne, Lying breeds periury, periury breedes haughtines of heart haughtines of heart breeds contempt,: contempt breedes obſtinacie, and brings forth much euill. And this is the whole progreſſe of ſin, he groweth from a lyer to a theefe, from a theefe to a murtherer, and neuer leaueth vntil hee hath ſearched all the roome in hell, and yet hee is neuer ſatiſfied, the more hee ſinneth, the more hee ſearcheth to ſin: when he hath deceiued, nay he hath not deceiued thee: aſſoone as hee hath that he deſireth, hee hath not that hee deſireth: when he hath left fighting, he goeth to fighting againe: yet a little and a little more, and ſo wee flit from one ſinne to another,, While I preach, you heare iniquitie ingender within you, and will breake forth as ſoone as you are gone. So Chriſt wept, Ieruſalem laughed: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> brake one, and wee breake ten: like children which laugh and cry, ſo, as if wee kept a ſhop of vices, now this ſinne, and then that, from one ſinne to another.</p>
                     <q>O remember thy end, ſaith Salomon, and that thou muſt come to iudgement.</q>
                     <p>What ſhall become of them that haue tryed them moſt? Bee condemned moſt, <hi>Reioyce, O young man, in thy youth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if thou marke <hi>Salomon,</hi> he harpes vpon one ſtring hee doubles it againe and againe, to ſhew vs things of his
<pb facs="tcp:25609:27"/> owne experience, becauſe wee are ſo forgetfull thereof in our ſelues, like the dreamer, that forgetteth his dreame, and the ſwearer his ſwearing. So wee begge of euery vncleane ſpirit, vntill wee haue bumbaſted our ſelues vp to the throat, filling euery corner of our heartes withall vncleanneſſe, and then we are like the dogge that commeth out of the ſinke, and maketh euery one as foule as himſelfe: therefore ſayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> If any one will learne the way to hell, let him take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Me thinke I ſee the Dialogue betweene the fleſh and the Spirit. the worſt ſpeaketh firſt, and the fleſh ſayth, Soule, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke, and goe braue, lye ſoft, what elſe ſhould you doe but take your pleaſure? thou knoweſt what a pleaſant fellowe I haue beene vnto thee, thou knoweſt what delight thou haſt had by my meanes: but the ſoule commeth in, burthened with that which hath beene ſpoken before, and ſayth, I pray thee remember iudgement, thou muſt giue account for all theſe things, for vnleſſe you repent, you ſhall ſurely periſh,</p>
                     <p>No, ſayth the fleſhe, talke not of ſuch graue matters, but tell mee of fine matters, of ſoft beddes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things, and talke mee of braue paſtimes, Apes, Beares, and Puppits, for I tell thee, the forbidden fruite is ſweeteſt of all fruites: for I doe not like of your tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mee of iudgement: but take thou thy iewels, thy inſtrument, and all the ſtrings of vanitie will ſtrike at once, for the fleſh loues to be braue, and tread vpon corks, it cannot tell what faſhion to bee of, and yet to bee of the new faſhion.</p>
                     <q>Reioyce, O yong man in thy youth.</q>
                     <p>O this goes braue, for while wickedneſſe hath caſt his rubs, and vengeance caſtes his ſpurres, and his foote,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:28"/> and thus ſhee reeles, and now ſhe tumbles, and then ſhee falles: therefore this progreſſe is ended.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſure is but a ſpurre, riches but a thorne, glorie but a blaſt, beautie but a flowre, ſinne is but an hypocrite, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in thy mouth, and poyſon in thy ſtomacke: therefore let vs come againe and aske <hi>Salomon</hi> in good ſooth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee meaneth in good earneſt, when hee ſpake theſe words: O (ſayth <hi>Salomon) It is the beſt life in the world to goe braue, lie ſoft, and liue merrily, if there were no iudgement.</hi> But this iudgement marres all, it is like a dampe that puts out all the light, and like a boxe that marreth all the oyntment: for if this bee true, wee haue ſpunne a fayre threed, that wee muſt anſwere for all, that are not able to anſwere for one: why, <hi>Salomon</hi> maketh vs fooles, and giueth vs gawdes to play withall: what then, ſhall wee not reioyce at all? Yes, there is a godly mirth and if wee could hit on it, which is called, Be merry and wiſe. <hi>Sara</hi> laughed, and was reprooued: <hi>Abraham</hi> laughed, and was not reprooued. And thus much for the firſt part.</p>
                     <q>But remember, for all theſe things thou ſhalt come to iudgement.</q>
                     <p>This Verſe is as it were a Dialogue betwixt the fleſhe and the ſpirite, as the two counſellers: the worſt is firſt, and the fleſhe ſpeaketh proudly, but the ſpirite comes in burdened with that which hath beene ſpoken. The fleſhe goeth laughing and ſinging to hell: but the ſpirite caſteth rubs in his way, and puts him in minde of iudgement, that for all theſe thinges, now ends reioyce, and heere comes in but: if this but were not, wee might reioyce ſtill: if young men muſt for all the ſportes of youth, what then ſhall old men doe, being as they are now? Surely, if <hi>Salomon</hi> liued to ſee our old men liue now, as heere hee ſaith of young men, ſo high as ſinne rageth, yet vengeance ſits aboue it, as high as high Babell. Mee thinkes I ſee a ſword hang in the ayre by a twine threed, and all the
<pb facs="tcp:25609:28"/> ſonnes of men labour to burſt it in ſunder. There is a place in hell where the couetous Iudge ſitteth, the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Lawyer, the griping Landlord, the careleſſe Byſhop, the luſty youth, the wanton Dames, the theefe, the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-wealth, they are puniſhed in this life becauſe they euer ſinne as long as they could, while mercie was offered vnto them: therefore, becauſe they would we bee waſhed, they ſhall bee drowned. Now put together reioyce and remember: thou haſt learned to bee merry, now learne to bee wiſe: nowe therefore turne o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer a new leafe, and take a new Leſſon; for now <hi>Salomon</hi> mocked not as hee did before, therefore, a checke to thy ruffes, a checke to thy cuffes, a checke to thy robes, a checke to thy gold, a checke to your riches, a checke to your beautie, a checke to your mucke, a checke to your graues: woe from aboue, woe from belowe, woe vnto all the ſtings of vanitie: doeſt thou not now maruell that thou haſt not a feeling of ſinne? for now thou ſeeſt <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith true, thine owne heart can tell that it is wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked, but it cannot amend: therefore it is high time to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: as <hi>Nathan</hi> commeth to <hi>Dauid</hi> after <hi>Belzebub,</hi> ſo commeth accuſing conſcience after ſinne. Mee thinkes that euery one ſhould have a feeling of ſinne, though this day bee like yeſterday, and to morrowe like to day yet one day will come for all, and then woe, woe, woe and nothing but darkeneſſe: and though God came not to <hi>Adam</hi> vntill the euening, yet hee came: although the fire came not vpon Sodom till the Euening, yet it came: and ſo comes the Iudge, although hee bee not yet come, though hee haue leaden feete, hee hath iron hands, the arrowe ſlayeth and is not yet fallen, ſo is his wrath: the pitte is digged, the fire kindled; and all things are made readie and prepared againſt that day, onely the finall ſentence is to come, which will not long tarrie.</p>
                     <p>You may not thinke to bee like to the theefe that ſtea
<pb facs="tcp:25609:29"/> leth and is not ſeene: nothing can bee hid from him, and the Iudge followeth thee at thee heeles: and therefore whatſoeuer thou art, looke about thee, and doe nothing but that thou wouldeſt doe openly, for all things are ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnto him: <hi>Sara</hi> may not thinke to laugh and not bee ſeene: <hi>Gehezie</hi> may not thinke to lye and not be knowne: they that will not come to the banquet, muſt ſtand at the doore,</p>
                     <p>What, doe you thinke that God doth not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſinnes which wee doe not regard: for while we ſin the ſore runs on, and the Iudge ſetteth downe all in the table of remembrance, and his ſſcrowle reacheth vp to heauen.</p>
                     <p>Item, for lending to Vſurie, Item, for racking of rents Item, for deceuing thy brethren, Item, for falſhood in wares, Item, for ſtarching thy ruffes, Item, for curling thy haire. Item, for paynting thy face. Item, for for ſelling of benefices. Item, for ſtaruing of ſoules. Item, for playing at cardes. Item, for ſleeping in the Church.

The fornicator, for taking of filthy pleaſure: O ſonne, remember thou haſt taken thy pleaſure, take thy puniſhment. The careles Prelate, for murthering ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand ſoules. The Landlord, for getting money from his poore Tenants by racking of his rents: ſee the reſt, all they ſhall come like a very ſheep, when the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, and the heauen and earth ſhall come to iudgement againſt them, when the heauens ſhall vaniſh like a ſcrole, and the earth ſhall conſume like fire, and all the creatures ſtanding againſt them: the rocks ſhall cleaue aſunder, and the mountaines ſhake, and the foundation of the earth ſhall tremble, and they ſhall ſay to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Couer vs, fall vpon vs, and hide vs from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his anger and wrath, whom wee haue not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for to offend? but they ſhall not bee couered
<pb facs="tcp:25609:29"/> and hid: but then they ſhall goe the blacke way, to the Snakes and Serpents, to bee tormented of Deuils for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: O paine vnſpeakable: and yet the more I expreſſe it, the more horrible it is, when you thinke of torment paſſing all tormentes, and yet a torment paſſing all that: yet this torment is greater then them, and paſſing them all.</p>
                     <p>Imagine you ſee a ſinner going to hell, and his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gape at him, his acquaintance looke at him, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhoute at him, and the Saintes laugh at him, and the deuils rayle at him, and many looke him in the face, and they that ſaid they would liue and dye with him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and leaue him to pay all the ſcores: Then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das would reſtore his bribes: Eſau would caſt vp his pottage: Achan would caſt downe his golde, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi would refuſe his giftes: Nabuchadnezzar would bee humbler: Balam would bee faithfull, and the Prodigall would be tame.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinkes I ſee Achan running about, where ſhall I hide my golde that I haue ſtolne, that it might not bee ſeene nor ſtand to appeare for witneſſe againſt mee?</p>
                     <p>And Iudas running to the high Prieſts, ſaying, Hold, take againe your money, I will none of it, I haue betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the innocent bloud.</p>
                     <p>And Eſau crying for the bleſsing when it is too late, hauing ſold his birthright for a meſſe of pottage.</p>
                     <p>Woe, woe, woe, that euer wee were borne, O where is that Diues that would beleeue this, before hee felt the fire in hell, or that would beleeue the pooreſt Lazarus in the world, to bee better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, before the dreadfull day come when they cannot helpe it, if they would neuer ſo faine, when repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance is too late? Herod ſhall then wiſh that hee were Iohn Baptiſt. Pharaoh would wiſh that hee were Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Saul would wiſh that hee had bene Dauid. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,

Yea, I would giue all the goods in the world that I might eſcape this dreadfull day of wrath and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that I might not ſtand amongſt the goe. O that I might liue a begger all my life, and a Leaper: O that I might endure all plagues and ſores from the top of the head, to the ſole of my foote, ſuſtaine all ſickneſſe &amp; griefes, that I might eſcape this iudgement.</p>
                     <p>The guiltie conſcience cannot abide this day. The ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheepe when ſhee is taken will not bleate, but you may carry her, and doe what you will with her, and ſhee will bee ſubiect: but the ſwine, if ſhee bee once taken, ſhee will roare and cry, and thinkes ſhee is neuer taken but to bee ſlaine? So of all things, the guiltie conſcience cannot abide to heare of this day, for they know that when they heare of it, they heare of their owne condemnation. I thinke if there were a generall collection made through the whole world, that there might bee no iudgement day, then God would bee ſo rich, that the world would go a begging, &amp; bee as waſte wilderneſſe. Then the couetous Iudge would bring forth his bribes: then the craftie Lawyer would fetch out his bagges: the Vſurer would giue his gaine, and the idle ſeruant would digge vp his talent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and make a double thereof. But all the money in the world will not ſerue for our ſinne, but the Iudge muſt anſwere for his bribes hee that hath money, muſt anſwer how hee came by it, &amp; iuſt condemnation muſt come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery ſoule of them: then ſhall the ſinner bee euery dy
<pb facs="tcp:25609:30"/> ing, and neuer dead, like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> that is euer in the fire and neuer conſumed.</p>
                     <p>But if you come there, you may ſay as the Queene of Saba ſayde of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> I beleeue the report that I heard of thee in mine owne Countrie, but the one halfe of thy wiſedome was not tolde mee. If you came there to ſee what is done, you may ſay, Now I beleeue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that was told mee in my owne countrie concerning this place, but the one halfe as now I feele, I haue not heard of: now chuſe you whether you will reioyce, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: whether you will ſtand amongſt you bleſſed, or amongſt you curſed: whether you will enter while the gate is open, or knocke in vaine when the gate is ſhut: whether you will ſeeke the Lord whileſt he may be found, or be found of him when you would not bee ſought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run into the buſhes with <hi>Adam</hi> to hide your ſelues: whether you will take your heauen now here, or your hell then there: or through tribulation to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and thus to take your hell now here, or your heauen then there in the life to come with the bleſſed Saintes and Angels, ſo that hereafter you may lead a new life, putting on Ieſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe.</p>

                     <p>And to this end the word <hi>ſeeking</hi> is vſed in this place, that we may learne, that as the heauens and the planets, and the whole frame of nature were ordayned to finiſh their courſe by motions and operation: ſo man, as hee was ordained to a moſt bleſſed and happy end, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereunto, not by ſloth and idleneſſe, but by an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſeeking of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The kingdome of heauen is like a treaſure, which cannot bee found with out ſeeking and digging. It is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14.</note> like the precious pearle, for which the wiſe Marchant was content not onely to ſeeke, but to ſell all that hee had, to buy it. GOD hath placed vs heere in this world as huſbandmen, to plough vp the fallowe of our hearts: as labourers to worke in the vineyarde: as trauellers to ſeeke a Countrie, as ſouldiers to fight the battell of the Lord, againſt the fleſhe, the world, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
                     <p>And for this purpoſe hath hee propoſed vnto vs an vntilled lande, a vineyarde, a triple enemie to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: that wee might remember, that wee muſt till the ground, if wee will reape the fruite: that wee muſt prune
<pb facs="tcp:25609:33"/> the vine, if wee will drinke of the grape: that wee muſt fight, if wee will ouercome. <hi>Hee that tilleth the Land,</hi> (ſayth <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1 <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.</note> corrupt trees without fruit, twiſe dead, and pluckt vp by the rootes, engendring in the minde, a loathing of God and godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Eſchue therefore idleneſſe, I beſeech you, and by the want ye find in other, learne inſtructions for your ſelues. Be not forgetfull how buſie your enemie is, if hee find you idle: firſt, hee putteth you in minde of ſome vanitie: then offereth opportunitie to practiſe: then hee craueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and if ye grant him that, hee triumpheth by adding practiſe: he leaueth no meanes vnattempted, whereby he may ſubuert and bring you to perdition. To one (as to <hi>Euah)</hi> he promiſeth the knowledge of good and euil. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 22. 1. <hi>King</hi> 13 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2</note> he ſeduceth with lying ſpeeches, as he did <hi>Pharao</hi> the King, whom hee deceiued by falſe Prophets. To the Iewes he pretended the temple of the Lord. To the heathen hee ſheweth vniuerſalities and antiquities. And to other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers, hee leaueth no more vnattempted, whereby hee may entangle the ſoule of the ſimple, and wrappe them in the ſnares of death. Flye idleneſſe therefore, and ſeeke vertue, and the way thereof: ſeeke learning, as for a Iewell, make diligent ſearch and inquiſition after her: ſeeke early, and ſeeke late, in the morning ſow thy ſeede, and in the euening let not thy hand reſt: ſeeke him in the day of trouble, and hee will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie him.</p>
                     <p>Seeke him, there is the commaundement: hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thee, there is the promiſe: and thou ſhalt glorifie him, there is the condition. To diſobey the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is rebellion: to diſtruſt his promiſe, is infidelitie: to refuſe the condition, is vile ingratitude. Wherefore let
<pb facs="tcp:25609:33"/> vs ſeeke, and ſeeke earneſtly, with a feruent ſpirite, and humbleneſſe of heart, and let vs perſwade our ſelues, that there is no finding without ſeeking, no opening without knocking.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond circumſtance to be conſidered in this point, is to whom we muſt ſeeke for theſe thinges. Our direction <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 27</note> is made vnto God, <hi>For euery good and perfect gift is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, deſcending from the father of lights.</hi> And as for many cauſes wee are to ſeeke God, and to God alone, ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for theſe foure.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe we haue nothing of our ſelues, nor of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature, but whatſoeuer we haue, we haue it of God: for what haſt thou that thou haſt not receiued? in him we liue, wee moue, and haue our being. Art thou wiſe in thine owne conceit? O remember, that the wiſedome of the world is fooliſhneſſe with God. O conſider that the naturall man vnderſtandeth not the thinges of God. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1</note> Theſe thinges are hid from the wiſe and prudent, and are reuealed to babes and ſucklings. Alas, what were man if he were once left to himſelfe? A map of miſery, and a ſinke of calamitie. Alas, how were he able to reſiſt the fiery darts of the aduerſary, who continually goeth about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, ſeeking whom he may deuoure? Here yee may note firſt his malice, for he daily accuſeth vs before the cheif Iudge of the Kings bench: when he cannot preuaile in this court, but ſeeth his billes of accuſation repelled, then hee remoueth the matter to the court of our owne conſciences, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Reue.</hi> 2</note> where on the one ſide he layeth the bookes of the Law and ſtatutes made againſt ſinne: on the other ſide, the billes of accuſation brought in againſt vs out of the bookes of the Law, alleadging theſe ſtrickt places againſt vs: <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth, ſhall die the death. Curſed is hee that abideth not in euery point of the law, to doe it.</hi> On the other ſide, hee bringeth in our conſciences to witneſſe againſt vs, and then inferreth this hard concluſion: <hi>Therefore there is no hope in ſaluation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:34"/>
                     <p>Then if hee ſee that wee appeale from iuſtice to mercie, and ſay, At what time ſoeuer a ſinner repenteth, the Iudge putteth all his wickedneſſe out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, hee dealeth with vs, as craftie worldings deale in matters of Lawe, who when they ſee their matters paſſe againſt them in higher Courtes, bring downe their caſe into the Countrey, to bee decided by the Neighbours: who, either for their ſimplicitie cannot, or for their fauour dare not iudge of the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 So our aduerſarie, though God himſelfe doe diſcharge vs, though our conſcience doth teſtifie our innocencie: yet hee accuſeth in the thirde court before men, where hee is bold to powre out his whole venome and poyſon of his malice againſt vs, and to forge what lies, and ſlaunders, and libels he liſt, becauſe he knoweth they ſhal be receiued as true.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Thus hee accuſeth Chriſt Ieſus our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and cauſed diuers falſe and vntrue witneſſes to come in againſt him. But if hee were malicious onely to wiſh our deſtruction, and not mightie to wreake his malice, wee ſhould haue little cauſe to feare. but he is mightie, therefore he is tearmed a lion, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſſe, a great Dragon, which drewe to the earth, the third part of the ſtarres of heauen: that is, with earthly <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke.</hi> 11. <hi>Ephe</hi> 6. <hi>Reue.</hi> 12.</note> temptation to haue ouerthrowne them, which ſeemed to ſhine in the church of God as lampes and ſtarres. O then how eaſie is our ouerthrow, if the Lord did not hold vs vp, which ſhine not as ſtarres in heauen but creep like wormes on earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Yet if hee were but malicious and mightie, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with vs, but hee is fierce, and therefore called a roaring Lion, who laying waite for the bloud of the godly, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp bloud-thirſtie perſecutors to make themſelues drunke with the bloud of Saintes: as moſt greiuouſly hee did from the time of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> to the raigne of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25609:34"/> the ſpace of 294. yeares, ſlaying ſome by the ſword, burning other with fire, hanging ſome on the gallowes, drowning ſome in riuers, ſtabbing ſome with forkes of yron, preſſing others vnto death with ſtones deuouring many thouſands of the tender lambs of Chriſts flocke.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 To this malice, might and rage, is added his ſubtil po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licy, which he vſeth in circumuenting the faithfull he doth not pitch his tents in any one place, but walketh about from place to place to ſpie out his beſt aduantage, in the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> night hee ſoweth tares, and in the day hee hindreth the growth thereof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 He proceedeth after further, and addeth to his pollicy induſtrie, hee conſidereth our natures and diſpoſitions, and to what ſinnes wee doe moſt incline: and thereun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to hee applyeth himſelfe, ſometimes by flattery, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by feare, ſometimes by feeding our humours hee ſubtilly inticeth vs, ſometimes by violence hee goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enforce vs, ſometimes by changing himſelfe into an Angell of light, hee endeuoureth to betray our ſoules into his hands, and in whatſoeuer eſtate hee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, hee thereby taketh occaſion to lay ſiege to our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Thus ye ſee noted in a word, the force of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie: examine now yourſelues, whether you haue any thing in your ſelues, and you ſhall find nothing but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and corruption. It is God that giueth ſtrength to the mighty, wiſedome to the prudent, and knowledge to the vnderſtanding: hee teacheth <hi>Dauids</hi> hand to fight, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſa.</hi> 144.</note> and his fingers to battle, hee giueth ſtrength to his armes to breake abow, euen abow of ſteele: wherefore let nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the wiſe man glorie in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength: but let him that glorieth, glorie in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, wee are to ſeeke vnto God alone, becauſe none is ſo preſent as hee for God, becauſe hee is Almighty
<pb facs="tcp:25609:35"/> and with his power filleth both heauen and earth, is preſent alwaies with them that feare him, and readie to ſuccour them in diſtreſſe. The Lord is neare to all that call vpon him in truth, hee heareth our gronings &amp; ſighs and knoweth what things are neceſſarie for vs before wee aske.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon why we muſt ſeeke vnto God is, none is ſo able to helpe as hee: but of this I ſhall haue particular occaſion to ſpeake when I come to this point, <hi>And pray vnto the Almighty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth reaſon why we muſt ſeeke Chriſt alone is, becauſe there is none ſo willing to helpe vs as hee. It is a great courage to vs to make ſuite, when wee are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the willingneſſe of him to whome we make ſuite: &amp; I pray yee, who was euer more carefull for our ſaluation, and more watchfull ouer vs than the Lord? who euer put his truſt in him, and was confounded? In this reſpect hee is called a Father, becauſe as the father tendreth his ſonne ſo the Lord doth all thoſe that put their truſt in him. Can there bee any more willing to helpe vs than Chriſt, whoſe whole head was ſicke, and whoſe heart was heauie for our ſakes? yea, in whoſe bodie, from the ſole of the foot to the crowne of the head, was nothing but wounds and ſwellings and ſores? but alas, this was nothing to that hee ſuffered for our ſakes, Hee was compaſſed about with feares and horrours, till his ſweat was drops of bloud, and his bones bruiſed in the fleſh, hee was whipped and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and chaſtiſed with ſorrowes, till hee cryed out in the bitterneſſe of his ſoule, <hi>O Lord if it bee poſſible, let this cup paſſe from mee.</hi> The heauie hand of God was ſo grieuous vpon him, that hee bruſed his very bones, and rent his reynes aſunder: hee could finde no health in his fleſh, but was wounded, yea wounded to the death, euen the moſt bitter death vppon the Croſſe. His tender fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were nayled to the Croſſe, his face was wrinkled with weeping and wayling, his ſides imbrued and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:25609:35"/> with his owne bloud, ſpurting and guſhing freſh from his ribbes, the ſhaddow of death was vpon his eyes.</p>
                     <p>O what greife could bee like this, or what condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation could bee ſo heauie, ſith there was no wickedneſſe in his hands? ſith he was the brightneſſe of his fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the Sunne of righteouſneſſe that ſhined in the world, as to ſee his dayes at an ende, to ſee ſuch throbbing ſighs and carefull thoughts without cauſe of his, ſo deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingrauen in the tables of his breſt? But was this all? No, my brethren, ſith his excellencie was ſuch aboue all creatures, that the worlde was not worthy to giue him breath, it was a greater greife vnto him, to ſee himſelfe made a worme, and not a man, aſhame of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the people: to ſee his life ſhut vp in ſhame and reproches, how could it but ſhake his bones out of ioynt, and make his heart melt in the middeſt of his bowels? who was euer ſo full of woe, and brought ſo low into the duſt of death? vpon whom did the malice of Sathan euer get ſo great a conqueſt?</p>
                     <p>This though it were exceeding, yet it was not all, no, it was but a taſte of greife in compariſon of the reſt: behold therefore (if your wearie eyes will ſuffer you to behold) the depth of all miſeries yet behind: the ſinne that he hated, he muſt take vpon his owne body, and beare the wrath of his Father powred out againſt it. This is the fulneſſe of all paines that compaſſed him round about, which no tongue is able to vtter, or heart conceiue: the anger of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burned in him, euen to the bottome of hell, and deepe ſinke of confuſion: it wrapped him in the chaines of eternall death: it crucified him, and threwe him downe into the bottomleſſe pit of calamitie, and made his ſoule by weeping and wayling to melt into theſe bitter teares trickling from his eyes: <hi>O God my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O that my head were a well of water, and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

I dare not ſtand as I would vpon theſe points, fearing tediouſneſſe: wherefore let this ſuffice for the former general part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dutie we owe vnto God.</p>

                     <p>Now Gods promiſes for the performance hereof, yeeld vnto vs moſt plentifull matter of doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Firſt, of his iuſtice, that as hee will ſuffer no ſinne vnpuniſhed: ſo he will ſuffer no good worke vnrewarded but giueth to euery ſeuerall action, his ſeuerall hire, and iuſt recompence of reward. Shall the houre come, in which all that are in their graues, ſhall heare a voyce, and come forth, they that haue done well, to the reſurrection of life, they that haue done euill, to the reſurrection of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demnation? Shall the Lord ſearch Ieruſalem with Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes? Shall all full corners bee ſweept, and all pleites and wrinkles bee vnfolded? Shall the Sea, graue, death, and hell, giue vp all that is in them. And ſhall all the dead (both great and ſmall) ſtand before God, when the books are opened? And ſhall euery man haue praiſe of God ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording vnto his deſeruing: Shall wee then diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the veſſels of honour and of wrath, between ſheep and Goates, the iuſt and vniuſt? Finally, ſhall there be an infallible, generall, and incorrupt iudgement, wherein the booke of all our offences, ſhall bee laid wide open? Now God bee mercifull vnto vs: bee fauourable O Lord, be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable. But to proceede, it is thy nature, O Lord, to ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.</note> vp the wheate, and burne the tares, to cut downe all fruitleſſe trees, and caſt them into the fire: yea, into a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">

                     <p>Doth not the Lord ſpare Dauid, a king, and a Prophet for murther? Doth hee not ſpare the Sichemites for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie? Nor Abſalom for treaſon: Nor Saule for tyrannie? Nor Eli for negligence? nor A chab, Ieroboam, nor Ieza<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bel for cruelty? nor Herod, Nabuchadnezzar, and Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for pride? nor Pharaoh for incredulity? Then beefauo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable, O Lord, be fauourable to vs, in whom almoſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of theſe ſinnes doe dwell and remaine. Did the Lord for corruption ouer flow the world with water? Did
<pb facs="tcp:25609:40"/> hee burne Sodome for her villanie? Did hee caſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> out of Paradiſe, for eating of the forbidden fruite? Did hee ſtone a poore wretch to death, for gathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring chips on the Sabboth day? Then bee fauourable O Lord, bee fauourable vnto vs. But doth not the Lord ſpare the Cedar tree for his height, nor the Oke for his ſtrength? Nor the Poplar for his ſmoothneſſe? Nor the Lawrel for his greenneſſe? No verily, from the Cedar that is in <hi>Lybanon,</hi> euen to the Hyſop that groweth out of the wall, yea, euery one that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewne downe and caſt into the fire: it is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God, to render vengance to thoſe that diſobey him, and to deſtroy ſuch as haue forſaken the law by euerlaſting perdition.</p>
                     <p>Behold, the Lord ſhall come in the great and latter day of iudgement, when none ſhall eſcape his iudgement ſeate, with clouds ſhall hee come, and euery eye ſhall ſee him, euen they which pierced him thorow, ſhall alſo waile before him, being ſummoned all to appeare moſt feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before his imperiall throne of maieſtie: then bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable O Lord, bee fauourable. Alas, with what eies ſhal wee miſerable ſinners behold him, ſo gloriouſly ſitting in his royall kingdome, with all his mightie and holy. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and whole number of Saints, ſounding with the voice of the Archangell, and trumpet of God, cauſing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens to paſſe away with a noyſe, and the elements to melt like waxe, and the earth to burne with the workes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Yea, with what eyes ſhall wee behold him, when wee ſee the Sunne darkened, the Moone eclipſed, and the ſtars fall downe from heauen? But alas, when hee taketh the furbiſhed blade into his hand, when hee is readie to throw the fierie thunderboults of his wrath, when he ſummoneth before him the worme that neuer dieth, the fire that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall bee quenched, to reuenge vpon the wicked, into what a plight are they then driuen? Then leaue they off, Bee fauourable O Lord, bee fauourable, and ſay to the hils,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:40"/> O ye mountaines, come and couer vs. O yee waters come and ouerwhelme vs: woe, woe, woe, how great is this darkneſſe? The godly on the other ſide are bathed in ſuch ſtreames of bliſſe, and aduanced to ſuch happineſſe, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue can vtter, nor heart conceiue.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing wee haue to note in his promiſes, is his mercy, which exceedeth all his works. For God though hee haue giuen a curſe of the law againſt ſinners, yet ſeeing Chriſt for the penitent hath borne the curſe, whereby his iuſtice is not impared, he is content to accept our weaknes as our ſtrength, to recompence our imperfection with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of greateſt perfection, and that which wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme but in ſmall part, hee is content to accept as whole, nor for any deſert of ours, but in ſatisfaction of his ſonne, who payd with the ſeale of his owne bloud, the ranſome for our ſinnes, hee hath cancelled the hand-writing that was againſt vs. Wherefore wee are to pray vnto God, that whenſoeuer our ſinnes ſhall come in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that hee would looke vpon Chriſt Ieſus the true looking-glaſſe, in whom he ſhall finde vs moſt pure and innocent, and to ſhine moſt clearely in the righteouſneſſe which hee had giuen vs by faith: ſo that wee appeare not in our owne righteouſneſſe, but in the righteouſneſſe of the Lambe, who hauing taken away the ſinnes of the worlde, and hauing made vs as white as ſnowe, though wee were as red as crimſon, ſayth, hee will be mercifull to our iniquities, and will remember our ſinnes no more. Of him doe all the Prophets beare witneſſe, that through his name all that beleeue ſhall receiue remiſſion of their ſinnes. Againe, Drinke ye all of this; for this is my bloud which is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes. Chriſt gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for our ſinnes, that hee might deliuer vs from the curſe of the Law, euen according to the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chriſt bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree that we being deliuered from ſin, might liue in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by whoſe ſtripes wee are healed, for we were as ſheepe
<pb facs="tcp:25609:41"/> going aſtray, but are now returned to the ſhepheard and biſhop of our ſoules. It is no more but beleeue and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: beleeue, and receiue remiſſion: beleeue, and lay off thine owne righteouſneſſe, and inueſt thy ſelfe with the righteouſneſſe of the vnſpotted Lambe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dauid</hi> was young, and after was old, yet in all his daies he neuer ſaw the righteous forſaken. Sometimes he ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his children, but like a louing Father hee layeth no more vpon them then they are able to beare, for hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth them for his owne iuſtice, becauſe they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for his wiſedome, to exerciſe their faith: for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to cauſe them to repent: but this is the end of all, hee helpeth them in their diſtreſſes, hee reuengeth himſelfe vpon his enemies, and giueth to his people reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. O that we would therefore prayſe the Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all other his ſingular benefites: O that wee woulde confeſſe, that his mercy endureth for euer.</p>
                     <p>The third thing to note in his promiſes, is his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kindneſſe, in requiring ſo ſmall a thing, with ſo great and liberall bleſſings: and bindeth himſelfe by obligation (as it were) that as ſure as we performe the one, ſo hee will notfaile to accompliſh the other.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, is his patience and long ſuffering, which is not ſlackneſſe, as ſome men account ſlackneſſe: but is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, becauſe willingly hee would haue no man periſh, but gladly woulde haue all men to come to repentance. Hee is content to ſtay our leaſure, till wee ſeeke and pray vnto him: and neuer ſmiteth, till there bee no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe:</p>
                     <p>The fift, is his loue, in that hee is content to ſtirre vs vp to holy exerciſes, and puritie of life, and to allure vs with faire promiſes of ayde, and proſperous increaſe of all his bleſſings in this world. The particular examination of theſe bleſſings would require a larger diſcourſe, then (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tediouſneſſe) I dare preſume to trouble you withall: wherefore a word of each, and ſo I end.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:41"/>
                     <p>Touching the firſt, where it is ſaid, <hi>God will awake vp vnto thee,</hi> it is a greater benefit then the words import: for it ſignifieth, not onely that he will heare thee, but that hee will alſo doe what thou deſireſt, and ſatisfie thy requeſt. As long as the ſinner ſleepeth, the Lord is ſayd to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe: but as ſoone as the ſinner awaketh from ſinne, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.</note> God will ariſe (ſaith <hi>Dauid)</hi> and his enemies ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and they that hate him, ſhall flye before him: as the ſmoake vaniſheth before the wind, and as the waxe mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before the fire, euen ſo ſhall the wicked periſh at the preſence of God, Wherefore as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, ſo I exhort you, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                     <p>In the ſecond, hee promiſeth aboundance of worldly bleſſings, in recompence of prayer, for it is ſayd, <hi>Hee will make the habitation of thy righteouſneſſe proſperous,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reue.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28</note> the Lord will make peace within thy wals, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie within thy places: hee will commaund his bleſſings to be with thee in thy ſtorehouſe, and in all thou ſetteſt thy hand vnto: hee will open vnto thee his good treaſures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the heauens to giue raine on thy land in due ſeaſon. Thou ſhalt lay vp gold, as the duſt, and the gold of Ophir as the flint of the ryuer: thou ſhalt waſh thy pathes with butter, and thy rockes ſhall powre out riuers of oyle: thou <note place="margin">

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>for being pure and vpright,</hi> hee will make thy lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end greatly increaſe, and that thou mayeſt the leſſe miſtruſt his promiſe, he will doe it, though thy beginning be but ſmall.</p>
                     <p>Heere (brethren) yee ſee what a ſea of matter is offered me, whereunto if I would commit my ſelfe, I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto you, what ſtrange euents (by Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce)

But vpon whom hee hath beſtowed all theſe bleſsings, O how ſtrictly by good cauſe are they bound to magnifie the Lord, and to reioyce in God their Sauiour. Examine then your owne conſciences I beſeech you, whether God hath beſtowed all theſe bleſsings vpon you, or no: and if he haue, O what <note place="margin">

O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie houſe that entertained ſuch a gheſt! but thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie inhabitants to whome ſuch a gheſt woulde vouchſafe to come! When hee came to the ſwiniſh <hi>Gadarens,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25609:44"/> they deſired him to depart out of their coaſtes, preferring their ſwine aboue their Sauiour: but this godly family <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.</note> receiued him into their houſes, preferring their God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their golde, and the health of their ſoules before their worldly wealth. They receiued him into their houſe who had not a houſe wherein to put his head. Wherein their hoſpitalitie is commended, and ſhall certainly bee <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 19</note> rewarded at the dreadfull day: for with this and ſuch like workes of mercy, the Lord ſhall anſwer the ſentence of iudgement, which is to bee denounced againſt the wicked that neuer exerciſed thoſe workes of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Let vs learne by their example to bee harberous, and giuen to hoſpitality, which is ſo often commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the Scripture, and ſhall bee ſo richly rewarded at the laſt day. Thoſe godly Fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> entertained Angels in the habite of ſtrangers: ſo wee may daily entertaine Chriſt Ieſus in the habite of a poore <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 18 <hi>Gen.</hi> 19</note> man, of a blind man, of a lame man: and whatſoeuer is done vnto any of theſe that are his members, hee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and accepteth as done vnto himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Now as the vertue of hoſpitalitie is commendable in all ſorts of men: ſo is it more eſpecially commended to the Miniſters, who are expreſly commaunded by the Apoſtle among other things, to bee giuen to hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Num.</hi> 35</note> Vnto the Leuites in the time of the lawe, the Lord appointed cities of refuge, to ſignifie that the Miniſters houſe ſhould bee the poore mans harbour, and his ſtore their treaſure: but the true Miniſters of our daies haue no cities of refuge for others, for they haue none for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: they haue not wherewith to relieue the wants of others, for they haue not to relieue their owne.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Martha</hi> had thus entertained Chriſt as hee was man, into her houſe, <hi>Marie</hi> began to entertaine him as hee was GOD, into her heart, ſhee ſat at his feete to heare his preaching, for no ſooner was Chriſt come into the houſe, but that he tooke occaſion to teach and inſtruct
<pb facs="tcp:25609:45"/> the family, and in ſtead of bodily foode, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, to giue vnto them the foode of the ſoule.

This ſhould bee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faithfull Miniſters, when they are inuited to great feaſtes, that as they are called the ſalt of the earth, which ſerueth to ſeaſon the meates, to make them ſauourie and <note place="margin">

                     <p>Theſe ſiſters were godly women, and both earneſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of Ieſus Chriſt and yet in the maner of their deuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion there is ſuch difference, that the worldly affection of the one, may in ſome ſort bee miſliked, in reſpect of the godly exerciſe and practiſe of the other: <hi>Martha</hi> is ſore in cumbred with much ſeruing where a little ſeruice had bin ſufficient, but <hi>Mary</hi> is attentiue to heare the word of God which neuer can be heard ſufficiently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marie</hi> ſitteth to heare the word, as Chriſt vſed to ſit when hee preached the word, to ſhew that the word is to bee preached and heard with a quiet mind. In a ſtill night <note place="margin">

                     <p>Thus in Chriſt we haue the patience of a good paſtour and in <hi>Marie,</hi> the patterne of a good hearer.

                           <hi>Math.</hi> 6</note> for the things of this life</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Marie</hi> was carefull for the foode of the ſoule <hi>Martha</hi> was curious to prouide foode for the body, her greateſt care was to entertaine Chriſt, and to make him good cheere, to teſtifie her thankfull mind vnto him that had done ſo great things for them, he had raiſed her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death to life, therefore he was worthy to be well entertained.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Elias</hi> deſerued to be well dealt withall at the hand of his hoſteſſe, whoſe ſonne hee had reſtored to life: or <hi>Eliſa</hi> deſerued ſuch entertainement for her ſonnes reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ki.</hi> 17.</note> then ſurely our Sauiour Chriſt is worthy to bee wel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come hither, where hee had rayſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 4</note> graue, wherein hee had lyen by the ſpace of foure dayes before.</p>
                     <p>It was well done therefore of <hi>Martha</hi> to ſhewe her thankefull mind vnto Chriſt, but it was not well done at that time to ſhew her felfe thankfull in that maner: it was <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:25609:46"/> the word, it was no time for her to ſpend that time in other affaires, and to neglect the greateſt affaire, the meanes of her owne ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>It was not vnlawfull for <hi>Martha</hi> to labour, no more then it was vnlawfull for <hi>Peter</hi> to ſleepe: but when Chriſt <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note> was preaching, it was no time for her to bee ſo buſie, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, no more then it was time for <hi>Peter</hi> to ſleepe, when <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke.</hi> 5.</note> Chriſt willed him ſo earneſtly to watch and pray. When Chriſt preached out of <hi>Simons</hi> ſhippe to the people that ſtood vpon the ſhore, it was no time for <hi>Peter</hi> to play the fiſherman. But when Chriſt had left ſpeaking, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to launch into the deepe, then it was time for <hi>Peter</hi> to let downe the net.</p>
                     <p>There is a time wherein wee ought to labour in our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and a time wherein we ought to heare the word, and as we may not vtterly neglect our lawfull callings to follow ſermons, ſo muſt we not beſtow the Sabboth, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the ſeruice of God, in following the workes of our vocation. All things haue their appointed time (ſayth the wiſe man) <hi>Ec</hi> 3. and euery thing is ſeemely in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſeaſon, but when things are done prepoſterouſly and out of order, there followeth confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Martha</hi> did not heare Chriſt, yet did ſhee labour for Chriſt: many in our dayes will neither labour for Chriſt, nor heare of Chriſt: but as the Iſraelites were <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Num.</hi> 21</note> wearie of their iournie in the wilderneſſe, and loathed that heauenly <hi>Manna,</hi> ſo theſe men are wearie of euery godly exerciſe, and are ſoone cloyed with the word of God.</p>
                     <p>The fiue fooliſh Virgins waſted their oyle to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and while they went to buy, were excluded the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 25</note> and theſe fooliſh men ſpend this time of grace vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wantonly, as though after this life there were no time of Iuſtice and vengeance to bee feared. The day ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for their pride or profite, the night is ſpent in ſport and pleaſure, and no time is left to heare the Worde. When wee are praying, they are playing: When
<pb facs="tcp:25609:47"/> wee are preaching, they are eating and drinking, like the old worlde, that eate and dranke, that married wiues, and gaue in marriage, while <hi>Noah</hi> was preparing the Arke for <note place="margin">

And as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues to ſerue their idole, ſo theſe men take dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous courſes, and ſtrangely trouble themſelues to ſerue the deuill.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Martha</hi> findeth her ſelfe agreiued, and begins <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen</hi> 37. 1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 17.</note> to enuie her ſiſters exerciſe, as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren enuied him for his dreames: and the ſonnes of <hi>Iſhai,</hi> that diſdained their brother <hi>Dauid,</hi> for his forwardnes in the combate with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two ſiſters, that in other thinges agreede ſo well together, in this doe differ ſo much, that Chriſt muſt haue the hearing of the matter, and decide the controuerſie: <hi>Martha</hi> playeth the plaintife, and accuſeth her ſiſter. <hi>Marie</hi> the defendant anſwereth by her aduocate, and Chriſt himſelfe that tooke vppon him the office of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, is become the Iudge, and giueth ſentence on <hi>Maries</hi> ſide: <hi>Martha</hi> complayneth of her ſiſters ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and ſeemeth after a ſort to blame our Sauiour for winking at it, requiring him to ſee the matter redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpeedily. But Chriſt reprooueth <hi>Marthaes</hi> curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then excuſeth, yea, and commendeth <hi>Maries</hi> care.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Martha</hi> it appeareth how willing wee are to pleaſe ourſelues in our owne conceits, and how ready to conceiue amiſſe of others doings, yea, ſometimes to preferre our owne defects before the perfections of other men. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> chaſten his ſoule with faſting, it ſhall bee turned to his reproofe. If he put on ſackcloth, to teſtifie his contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.</note> ieſt at him, and the drunkards make ſongs of him. <hi>If Iohn Baptiſt</hi> be temperate in his apparell and diet, they will ſay, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 7 33</note> he hath a deuill. If <hi>Paul</hi> anſwere diſcreetly for himſelfe, hee ſhall bee charged to bee mad with ouermuch learning, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 26 <hi>Luke.</hi> 7. 34.</note> yea, if our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe frequent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb facs="tcp:25609:47"/> of ſinners, to reclaime them from ſinne, they will not ſticke to call him a friend and companion of Publicans and ſinners. Amongſt vs, if there bee any that bee more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in religion then the reſt and more diligent to heare the word, as <hi>Mary</hi> was, there ſhall not want ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cenſure them at their pleaſure, yea, to find fault, and to condemne them for ſo doing: yet are not the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcouraged herewith, or to deſiſt from their god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly exerciſes: for as the Lord anſwered for <hi>Mary:</hi> when ſhee held her peace, ſo the Lord will defend their cauſe and take their part againſt their aduerſaries. The Lord cannot abide to heare his ſeruants ill ſpoken of, but is alwayes ready to maintayne their right, and to anſwer for them, Hee will not ſuffer <hi>Laban</hi> to ſpeake an ill word <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Nu.</hi> 12.</note> to his ſeruant <hi>Iacob.</hi> And if <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> murmure againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lord will puniſh it with leproſie. What a comfortable thing is this to the godly, that the king of kings will take their parts, and will not ſuffer them to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any wrong? Hee is a moſt ſure and truſty friend, that will not abide his friendes to bee back-bited or ill ſpoken of, but eyther hee will anſwere in their defence, or he will find ſome meanes to ſtop their mouthes, and reſtraine the ſlandrous tongues of their enemies, as ſometime hee ſtopt <hi>Balaams</hi> paſſage, when hee went to curſe Gods people, and cauſed the dumbe beaſt to ſpeake, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nu.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 5.</note> the madneſſe of the prophet, rather then he would haue his people to be curſed.</p>
                     <p>The repetition of <hi>Marthaes</hi> name, argueth the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and earneſtnes of this admonition. The Lord is faine to bee very earneſt and importunate with vs, before hee can reclaime vs. So when God ſpake vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> bee called him twiſe by name: Chriſt called <hi>Peter</hi> thrice by name, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21, to cauſe him make his threefolde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> to make amends for his three-fold deniall. And when the Lord ſpake vnto <hi>Samuel,</hi> hee called him 4. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times by name, before hee anſwered: for ſuch is the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.</note>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25609:48"/> great mercie of God, that hee is content to admoniſh vs often of our dutie, and ſuch is the dulneſſe and peruerſnes of our crooked nature, that wee cannot bee gained by the firſt admonition: but the Lord muſt call vs often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, before we will hearken vnto him.</p>
                     <p>There are two things in the ſpeech of Chriſt to be ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued. The firſt is, his modeſt reprehenſion of <hi>Marthaes</hi> immoderate care: the other is, his friendly defence of <hi>Maries choyce.</hi> Though <hi>Martha</hi> was very carefull to entertaine Chriſt in the beſt maner, yet if hee perceiue a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thing in her worthy reprehenſion, hee will not ſticke to tell her of it: hee will not ſooth her in her ſaying, nor ſmooth her in her owne conceit, for all the trouble and coſt that ſhee beſtowes vpon him. If wee be often inuited to ſome mans table, and kindly entertained, it would be vnkindly taken if wee ſhould find fault with any diſorder: but for as much as all Chriſt his actions are the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtians, therefore euery Chriſtian, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preachers, whome it more ſpecially concerneth, muſt learne by this example how to behaue themſelues when they are inuited to great feaſtes, namely ſpeake their conſcience freely when they ſee a fault. The beſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall that wee can make for our good cheare, is to giue good counſell and wholeſome admonitions to them that inuite vs When Chriſt dined with the Phariſie, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and was miſliked for not waſhing before dinner, he tooke occaſion to reproue their hypocriſie, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of holines, which was the ſinne of the Phariſes and at another time hee noteth them for preſsing to the chiefe places at banquets, and ſheweth what modeſty is to be obſerued in ſitting downe to meate, and what gheſts ſhould bee bidden to our table. So ſhould Preachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:25609:48"/> I will warne you of one thing that will doe you good, that you woulde leaue your vſurie and extortion, your coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes and oppreſſion, that you would leaue your ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and blaſpheming the name of God, that you woulde forbeare to prophane the Lords Sabboth, that you would leaue your pride, and exceſſe in your diet and apparell, that you woulde forbeare to ſpeake ill of any behinde their backes, or to beare any malice or hatred to any of your neighbours.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the faultes which are eaſie to bee eſpied almoſt in euery place and theſe are the faultes which the faithfull miniſter of Chriſt Ieſus ſhoulde not leaue vnreprooued <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18 <hi>Mat.</hi> 14 <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 20.</note> whereſoeuer hee commeth. But as <hi>Elias</hi> told <hi>Ahab</hi> of his idolatry, though hee were his king, and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> tolde <hi>Herede</hi> of his adulterie, though hee did many things for him, and heard him gladly: ſo ſhould the preachers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the people for their notorious offences, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome fauours and curteſies receiued from them. If Chriſt had cauſe to find fault with <hi>Martha</hi> for her too much diligence in his entertainment, it ſeemeth hee was not curious in his diet, but would haue been content with ſimple cates, hee was no delicate or daintie gheſt, he did not affect or delight in ſumptuous banquets, or coſtly fare, he rather requireth a religious heart, a conſtant faith, a willing mind to heare the word, with an earneſt care to liue thereafter. Theſe are the thinges wherein the Lorde delighteth: theſe are the iuncates which hee deſireth, and which he preferreth before all earthly cheare.</p>
                     <p>Thus is <hi>Martha</hi> reprehended for her curiouſitie: nowe let vs ſee how <hi>Mary</hi> is excuſed and commended for her godly care. One thing is neceſſary (ſayth Chriſt:) and what is that one thing: Euen to heare the word preached, which is the power of God to ſaluation, to euery one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. A man may better want all thinges, then that one needefull thing, and yet wee deſire all other thinges, and neglect that one thing, which is ſo needfull.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:49"/>
                     <p>This one thing hath <hi>Marie</hi> choſen, and therefore hath choſen the better part. <hi>Marthaes</hi> part is good, becauſe it prouideth for this preſent life: but <hi>Maries</hi> part is better, becauſe it leadeth to eternall life. It is good to bee occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about our calling, to get our liuing: but it is better to be occupied in hearing the word which is able to ſaue our ſoules. As the head and the foote are both needfull in the body, ſo <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> are both needefull in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: man hath two vocations, the one earthlie, by his labour: the other heauenly, by his prayer. There is the actiue life, which conſiſteth in practiſing the affaires of this life, wherein man ſheweth himſelfe to be like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and there is the contemplatiue life, which conſiſteth in the meditation of diuine and heauenly things, wherein man ſheweth himſelfe to bee like the Angels: for they which labour in their temporall vocations, doe liue like men, but they which labour in ſpirituall matters, liue like Angels. When they heare the word, God ſpeaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: when they pray, they ſpeake vnto God: ſo that there is a continuall conference betweene God and them, becauſe they are continually, exerciſed in hearing and praying.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt loued <hi>Martha</hi> for her hoſpitality, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> loued <hi>Eſau</hi> for his veniſon. So did he loue <hi>Mary</hi> for her diligence in hearing his word, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> for harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her voyce. A Nurſe which hath her breaſt full of milke, doth loue the child that ſucks it from her: and Chriſt <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 25 28.</note> which hath his breaſt full of heauenly milke, is glad when he hath children to ſucke the ſame, Let vs therefore (as the Apoſtle willeth vs, 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 12,) laying aſide all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſnes, and all guile, and diſſimulation, and enuy, and all euill ſpeaking, as new borne babes, deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that wee may grow thereby to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men in Chriſt Ieſus: let vs breathe after the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the liuing water, which ſpringeth vp vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: and as the faintie Hart deſireth the water brooke <note place="margin">

                     <p>This is that good part which <hi>Marie</hi> hath choſen, by ſo much better then her ſiſters choyce, becauſe it concerneth a better life, and hath the fruition of this preſent life. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> hath a double portion: ſhee heard the word, and eate of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8</note> the meate which her ſiſter dreſſed, for godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and of the life to come. As for all other things, whether they bee honors, promotions, pleaſures, and what not? they ſerue onely for the maintenance of this preſent life, which is ſo ſhort and ſubiect to mutabilitie: but the word of GOD is the foode of the ſoule, the bread of life, that immortall ſeede which bringeth forth fruit vnto <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13.</note> eternall life.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, wee are to ſpeake of <hi>Noah,</hi> then of <hi>Cham</hi> his wicked ſonne &amp; after of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iapheth</hi> his good ſonnes: In <hi>Noah</hi> firſt of that which he did well, and then of his ſinne, In <hi>Cham:</hi> firſt of his ſinne, &amp; then of his curſe. In his brethren, firſt of their reuerence, and then of their bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Now wee will ſpeake of the father, and after of his children <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) that Noah began to bee an husbandman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the firſt name which is giuen to <hi>Noah</hi> after the flood, hee is called a huſbandman and the firſt work which is mentioned, was the planting of a vineyard: one would thinke when all men were drowned with the flood, and none left a liue to poſſeſſe the earth but <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſons, that hee ſhould haue found himſelfe ſomething elſe to doe
<pb facs="tcp:25609:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> then to plant vineyards: and that the holy Ghoſt ſhould haue intituled him King of the world, and not a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the earth, ſeeing there bee no ſuch men as <hi>Noah</hi> was, which hath more in his hand, then any King hath in the world, or ſhall haue to the worlds end: but thereby the holy Ghoſt would ſhewe, that God doth not reſpect Kings for their titles, nor men for their riches, as we doe, and therefore hee nameth <hi>Noah</hi> after the worke which hee did, not after the poſſeſſions which hee had, an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemeth that there was great diuerſitie betweene this age and ours: for if wee ſhould ſee now a King goe to plough, a noble man to driue the teame, a gentleman keep ſheep, hee ſhould be ſcorned for his labour, more then <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ah</hi> was for his drunkenneſſe: yet when wee read how this Monarch of the world thought no ſcorn to play the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, wee conſider not his princely calling nor his ancient yeares, nor his large poſſeſsions to commend his induſtrie, or modeſtie, or lowely mind therein. Which may teach vs humility, though wee learne to diſdaine husbandry. Of whom will we learne to be humble, if kings giue examples, and the ſonne of God humbleth himſelfe from heauen to earth, and yet wee contemne the example of the kings of the earth, and the example of the King of heauen?</p>
                     <p>The time was when <hi>Adam</hi> digged and delued, and <hi>Dauid</hi> kept ſheepe, and all the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men occupied about cattell: but as they for this were abhominable to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaieth in the ſame verſe) ſo they which doe like them, are abhorred of their brethren: and they which liue by them, ſcorne them for their worke, which would bee chaſtened themſelues, becauſe they worke not.</p>
                     <p>There was no art nor ſcience which was ſomuch ſet by in former times, and is now profitable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, bringing leſie profit vnto her ſelfe that may
<pb facs="tcp:25609:51"/> ſo iuſtly complaine of her fall without cauſe, and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from them that liue by her, as this painefull ſcience of husbandry: that it is maruell that any man will take the paine for the reſt, to be contemned for his labour, and bee a ſcorne for the reſt, which might hunger and ſtarue, if hee did not labour for them more then they doe for themſelues. No maruaile then though many in the poore countries murmure and complayne, that other cannot liue by them, and they cannot liue themſelues: but it is maruell if their complaints doe not grow in time to rebellion, and pull others as low as themſelues: for why ſhould the greateſt paine yeelde the leſſe profit? yet this is their caſe, for if you marke, you ſhall ſee, that the husbandman doth bare the price of his fruites ſo ſoone as the dearth is paſt, though hee raiſeth it a little while the dearth laſteth: but they which rayſe the price of their wares with him, ſeldome fall againe, but make men pay as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>are when the dearth is paſt, as if it were a dearth ſtill. Thus a plentifull yeare doth dammage him, and a hard yeare doth vantage them. So this painefull man is faine to liue poorely, fare meanely, goe barely, houſe homelie, riſe early, labour dayly, ſell cheape, and buy deare, that I may truely ſay, that no man deſerueth his liuing better, no man fulfilleth the law neerer: that is, Thou ſhalt get thy liuing in the ſweate of thy browes, then this poore ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> which picks his crums out of the earth. Therefore he ſhould not bee mocked for his labour, which hath vexation mough though all men ſpeake well of him: and in my opinion, if any deſerue to bee loued for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, or for his truth, or his paine, or the good which he brings to the Common-wealth, this Realme is not ſo much beholding to any ſort of men, (but thoſe that feede the ſoule) as thoſe that feede the bodie, that is, thoſe that labour the earth: yet you ſee how they liue like drudges, as though they were your ſeruantes to prouide foode for you, and after to bring it to your doores: as the beaſtes
<pb facs="tcp:25609:52"/> ſerue them, ſo they ſerue you, as though you were another kinde of men. I cannot thinke vppon their miſerie, but my thoughts tell mee, that it is a great part of our vnthankefulneſſe, that wee neuer conſider what an eaſie life and liuing God hath giuen vnto vs, in reſpect of them.</p>
                     <p>If the Apoſtles rule were kept, they which doe not worke, ſhould not eate: but now they which doe not worke, eate moſt, and the husbandmen which worke, eate not, but are like Bees, which prouide foode for other and pinch themſelues. Let vs conſider this, for they had not one law and wee another: but the ſame curſe which was denounced vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> was denounced vpon all his children. That euery man ſhoulde get his liuing in the ſweat of his browes. Although I know there be diuers workes, and diuers gifts, and diuers callings to worke in: yet alwayes prouided, they which doe not worke ſhoulde not eate, for in the ſweat of thy browes, that is, in labour &amp; trauell: thou King, and thou Iudge, and thou Prelate, and thou Landlord, and thou Gentleman, ſhalt get thy liuing, as <hi>Adam</hi> thy father did, or elſe thou doeſt auoid the curſe, and a greater curſe ſhall follow, that is, they which will not ſweat on earth, ſhall ſweat in hell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> had food as well as thou, and ſo had <hi>Noah,</hi> and more then thou, vnleſſe thou hadſt all, for they had all, and yet they might not be idle: becauſe their hands were not giuen them for nothing: ſome worke with their pen, ſome with their tongues, ſome with their fingers: as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made nothing idle, but that hee which is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, ſhould doe the worke of a Magiſtrate: hee which is a Iudge, ſhould doe the worke of a Iudge: hee which is a Captaine, ſhould doe the worke of a Captaine: he which is a miniſter, ſhould doe the worke of a miniſter: as when <hi>Noah</hi> was called an husbandman, hee did the worke of an husbandman. This contempt of the country, doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten danger to the land, as much as any thing elſe in our
<pb facs="tcp:25609:52"/> dayes, vnleſſe their burthen bee eaſed, and their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation qualified in ſome part to their paines. Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that you haue not heard of this theame before, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words of my text did lye for it, thus much I haue ſpoken to put you in mind how eaſily you liue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, and to rectifie our minds towards our poore brethren, which in deed ſeeme too baſe in our eyes, and are ſcorned for their labours, as much as wee ſhould be for our idleneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Then (ſaith <hi>Moſes)</hi> Noah <hi>hegan to bee an husbandman</hi> In that itis here ſaid that <hi>Noah began,</hi> it doth not diſprooue that hee gaue not himſelfe to husbandrie before, but it importeth, that <hi>Noah</hi> began to ſet vp husbandry againe after the flood before any other, ſo this good man recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the experience of Gods fauour (which had exempted him and his ſeed out of all the world) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing to ſee the face of the earth againe after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were gone, though an old man, and weaker then he was, yet hee returned to his labour a freſh, and ſcorned not to till and plant for all his poſſeſsions as though hee were an husbandman: ſuch a lowlines is all wayes ioyned with the feare of God, that they that are humbled with religion, doe not thinke themſelues too good to doe any good thing.</p>
                     <p>Heere note by the way, that none of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonnes are ſaid to begin this worke, but <hi>Noah</hi> himſelfe, the olde man, the hoary head and carefull father begins to teach the reſt, and ſhewes his ſonnes the way how they ſhould prouide for their ſonnes, and how all the world after ſhould labour and trauell, till they returne to duſt ſo the olde man whome age diſpenceth withall to take his eaſe, is more willing to prouide for the wants of his children, then they are which are bound to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for themſelues and their parents too, as the Storke doth feede the dam when ſhee is olde, becauſe the dam fedde her when ſhee was young. What a ſhame is
<pb facs="tcp:25609:53"/> this to <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iapheth,</hi> that is, to vs which are young and ſtrong, that the father ſhould bee called a labourer, when the ſonnes ſtand by? Now the ground was barren becauſe of the flood, and could not bring foorth fruit of it ſelfe, becauſe of the curſe: therefore it pittied <hi>Noah</hi> to ſee the deſolation and barrennes, and ſlime vpon the face of the earth, which hee had ſeene ſo glorious and ſweete, &amp; fertile, with all maner of hearbes and fruits and flowers before. Therefore hee ſetteth himſelfe to manure it, which waited for nothing now, but a painfull labourer to till and dreſſe it, that it might bring forth delights and profits for ſinfull man, as it did before.</p>
                     <p>By this wee may learne to vſe all meanes for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of Gods bleſſings, and not to loſe any thing which wee might haue or ſaue for want of paines: for that is ſinne, as <hi>Salomon</hi> noteth in the 24. of the Prouerbs, when hee reproueth the ſlouthfull husbandman, becauſe his fielde brought forth nettles and thiſtles, in ſtead of grapes, not becauſe the ground would not beare grapes, but becauſe the ſlouthfull man would not ſet them. Shall God commaund the earth and all his creatures to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe for vs, and ſhall not wee further their increaſe for ourſelues? As wee increaſe and multiply our ſelues, ſo wee are bound to ioyne hand and helpe, that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may increaſe and multiply too, or elſe the fathers ſhould eate the childrens portion, and in time there would bee nothing left for them that come after: this regard <hi>Noah</hi> ſeemeth to haue vnto his poſteritie, and therefore hee gaue himſelfe vnto husbandry, which is commended in him vnto this day, and ſhall bee recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him ſo long as this booke is read: whereby wee are warned, that hee which liueth onely to himſelfe, is not to bee remembred of them which liue after: But as <hi>Dauid</hi> cared how the realme ſhould bee gouerned after his death, as well as hee did during his life: ſo though we die and depart this world, yet wee ſhould leaue that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:25609:53"/> or thoſe bookes, or thoſe workes, behind vs, which may profit the Church and Common wealth when wee are dead and buried, as much as wee did when wee liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: Euen as <hi>Noah</hi> planted a vineyard, not for himſelfe, but for the ages to come after.</p>
                     <p>Some doe thinke that <hi>Noah</hi> planted the firſt vineyard and drunke the firſt wine, and that there was no vſe of grapes before: which opinion they are led vnto, that they might excuſe <hi>Noah</hi> and mitigate his fault, if he did ſup too deepe of that cup, the ſtrength and operation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not knowne vnto him, nor vnto any man before. But it is not like, that the excellent liquor and wholſome iuice of the Grape did lye hid from the world ſo many hundred yeares, and no doubt but there were vines from the beginning, created with other trees: for how could <hi>Noah</hi> plant a vineyard, vnleſſe hee had ſlips of other vines or graps that grew before, ſeeing hee did not create fruits but plant fruites as wee doe? For this is principally to be noted, that ſo ſoone as hee had opportunitie to doe good, hee omitted no time, but preſently after the flood was gone, and that the earth began to drie, hee plied it with ſeedes, and wrought it till hee ſaw the ſruites of his labour By this wee learne, to omit no occaſion to doe good but whenſoeuer wee may doe good to count it ſinne if we doe it not.</p>
                     <p>But if wee be ſo exerciſed, then all our works ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per like the vineyard of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe the fruit of the vine doth cheare the countenance and glad the heart of man. Therefore ſome haue gathered vpon the planting of this vineyard, a ſignification of gladneſſe and thankfulneſſe in <hi>Noah</hi> for his late deliuerance, as the Iewes by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſtes did celebrate the memoriall of ſome great be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefit but I rather iudge, that God would haue vs ſee in this example, what men did in thoſe dayes, and how wee are degenerare from our parents, that wee may prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fire, as <hi>Noah</hi> prepared againſt the water,</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:54"/>
                     <p>This is worthy to bee noted too, that GOD did not ſo regard his husbandrie, but that hee had an eye to his drunkenneſſe, and ſpeakes of his faulte as well as his vertue, whereby wee are warned, that though God bleſſe vs now while wee remember him, yet hee will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten vs ſo ſoone as wee forget him: though wee bee in a good name now, infamy will riſe in an houre: though wee bee rich at this preſent, pouertie may come preſently though wee bee whole while we bee heere, yet we may fall ſicke before night, euen as <hi>Noah</hi> is praiſed in one verſe, and diſpraiſed in another: euen now God commends him for his lowlineſſe, and now diſcommends him for his drunkenneſſe: as though hee had forgot all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, ſo ſoone as hee had ſinned, and would call in his praiſe againe.</p>
                     <p>This was to ſhewe, that <hi>Noah</hi> was not ſaued from the flood becauſe hee deſerued to bee ſaued, but becauſe God had a fauour vnto him: for hee which was not drowned with water, was after drowned with Wine. As the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes when they had done well, were proude of it, and loſt their reward: ſo when <hi>Noah</hi> had done a good worke, he ſpotted it with ſin, and was diſpraiſed where hee was prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as though God had repented him that hee commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded him. Hee planted well, but hee drunke not well: therefore that which was good, did him no hurt: then ſeeing he was trapped with a good worke, whatſoeuer we doe, we may remember how eaſie it is to ſin, if we miſſe in the matter, or in the maner, or time, or place, or the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, as <hi>Noah</hi> did. Hee which planteth the vineyard, is worthy to taſte of the grape: but if thou haue found ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> eate not to much, leaſt thou ſurfet. So if thou haſt found wine, drinke not too much, leaſt thou ſurfet. A little wine is better then a great deale, and if thou wilt follow the Apoſtles counſell, thou muſt drinke it but for thy ſtomacks ſake, leaſt that happen to thee, which thou ſhalt heare of this noble Patriarch.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25609:54"/>
                     <p>Though hee were neuer ſo righteous before God and men, though hee eſcaped the deſtruction, which lighted vpon all the world, though hee had all the foules of the ayre and beaſts of the land at his commaund, though hee paſſed the pilgrimage of man nine hundred yeares, yet <hi>Noah</hi> was but a man: ſo ancient, ſo righteous, ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo happie, <hi>Noah</hi> ſhewed himſelfe but a man, for drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the wine which himſelfe had planted, hee was drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This was <hi>Noahs</hi> fault, he was drunken with his owne wine, as <hi>Lot</hi> was defiled with his owne daughters. If <hi>Cham</hi> his ſonne had taken too much, and ſtript himſelfe as his father did, the holy Ghoſt would ſcarce haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it, becauſe he was a man of no note, but when the father forgat himſelfe, and gaue this offence, marke the maner of the holy Ghoſt, as though hee woulde ſhew you a wonder: hee diſplayeth <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkenneſſe, as <hi>Cham</hi> diſplayed his nakedneſſe: as if hee would ſay, Come and ſee the ſtrength of man. Hee which was counted ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, hee which beleeued the threatning like <hi>Lot</hi> when the reſt mocked, he to whom all the foules of the ayre and the beaſts of the earth flocked in couples as they came to <hi>Adam,</hi> hee which was reſerued to declare the iudgements of God, and to begin the world againe: <hi>Noah</hi> the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſobrietie, the example of moderation, is ouercome with drinke, as if hee had neuer beene the man. How eaſie, how quickly the iuſt, the wiſe, the prudent, hath loſt his ſenſe, his memorie, his reaſon, as though he had neuer been the man!</p>
                     <p>And how hard is it to auoid ſinne, when occaſion is at hand, and pleaſant opportunitie tempteth to ſinne? it is eaſier for the bird to goe by the net, then to breake the net: ſo it is eaſier for a man to auoide temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to ouercome temptations: therefore GOD forbad <hi>Balaam,</hi> not onely to curſe the people as <hi>Balak</hi> would haue him, but hee forbad him to goe with <hi>Balaks</hi> ſeruants, knowing that if he went with them, and ſaw the
<pb facs="tcp:25609:55"/> pompe of the Court, and heard the King himſelfe ſpeake vnto him, and felt the tickling reward, it would ſtraine his conſcience, and make him doubt whether hee ſhould curſe or bleſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> but warming himſelfe at <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire, was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a ſilly Damſell to doe that which hee neuer thought, euen to forſweare his Lord God: therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> would not eate of the kings meate, leaſt hee ſhould be tempted to the kings will, ſhewing vs that there is no way to eſcape ſinne, but to auoid occaſion. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth, <hi>Turne away mine eyes from vanitie:</hi> as though his eyes would draw his heart, as the bait tilleth on the hooke. <hi>Noah</hi> thought to drinke, hee thought not to bee drunke: but as he which commeth to the fielde to ſound the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, as ſlaine as ſoone as hee which commeth to fight: ſo the ſame wine diſtempereth <hi>Noah,</hi> which hath diſtempered ſo many ſince. Where he thought to take his reward, and taſte the fruite of his owne hands, God ſet an euerlaſting blot vpon him, which ſtickes faſt till this day, like a barre in his armes, ſo long as the name of <hi>Noah</hi> is ſpoken of, that wee cannot reade of his vertue, but wee muſt reade of his ſinne: whereby euerie man is warned to receiue the gifts of God reuerently, to vſe them ſoberly, and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie himſelfe, before hee reach forth his hand vnto them, that they may comfort and profit vs, with that ſecret bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which God hath hid in them: or elſe euerything, the beſt giftes of God may hurt vs, as the pleaſant wine ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confounded the great Patriarch, when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted too much in it, which hee might haue drunke as Chriſt did at his laſt ſupper, and this diſgrace had neuer beene written in his ſtorie: but GOD woulde haue a fearefull example like the pillar of ſalt, to ſtand before thoſe beaſtes, whoſe onely ſtrife is to make tryall, who can quaffe deepeſt and ſhewe all their valiantneſſe in wine.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe there is ſuch warning before vs, nowe wee
<pb facs="tcp:25609:55"/> haue the drunkard in ſchooling, I will ſpend the time that is left, to ſhewe you the deformitie of this ſinne. If a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny heare me which haue beene ouertaken with it, let them not maruell why hee cannot loue his enemies, which lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth ſuch an enemie, as this, which leadeth till hee reeleth duls him till hee bee a foole, and ſtealeth away his ſenſe, his witt, his memorie, his health, his credite, his friends: and when ſhee hath ſtripped him as bare as <hi>Noah,</hi> then ſhee expoſeth him like <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Cham,</hi> and all that ſee him do mocke him: it is a wonder almoſt, that any man would be drunke that hath ſeene a drunkard before, ſwelling and puffing, and foming, and ſpuing, and groueling like abeaſt for who would bee like a beaſt for all the world? Looke vpon the drunkard when his eyes ſtare, his mouth dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, his tongue faulters, his face flames, his hands trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his feete reele: how vgly, how monſtrous, how loth ſome doth he ſeeme to thee? So lothſome doſt thou ſeeme to others when thou art in like taking.</p>
                     <p>And how lothſome then doſt thou ſeeme to God? Therefore the firſt lawe that <hi>Adam</hi> receiued of God, was abſtinence, which if hee had kept, hee had kept all vertues beſide, but intemperancie loſt all, In abſtinence the lawe came to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and hee faſted when he receiued it, to ſhew that they which receiued the word of God, receiue it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly. A temperate man ſeldome ſinneth, becauſe the fleſh which doth tempt is mortified, leaſt it ſhould tempt but when the handmaide is aboue the miſtreſſe, and a man hath loſt the image of GOD, and ſcarſe retaineth the image of man, all his thoughts, and ſpeeches, and actions muſt needs bee ſinne, and nothing but ſinne, becauſe the band of vertue, ſobrietie, is broken, which kept all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when didſt thou want diſcretion to conſider? when didſt thou want patience to forgiue: When didſt thou want continencie to refraine? When didſt thou want heart to pray, but when ſobrietie was fled away, and in temperancie filled her roome? If ſhame let to ſinne, it
<pb facs="tcp:25609:56"/> caſteth out ſhame: if feare let to ſinne, it caſteth out feare: if loue let to ſinne, it expulſeth loue, if knowledge let to ſinne, it expulſeth knowledge, like a couetous Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, which would haue all to himſelfe and dwell alone.</p>
                     <p>There is no ſinne, but hath ſome ſhew of vertue, one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the ſinne of drunkenneſſe is like nothing but ſinne: there is no ſinne but although it hurt the Soule, it beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the body, or promiſeth profit, or pleaſure, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſomething to his ſeruants: onely drunkenneſſe is ſo impudent, that it deſcrieth it ſelfe: ſo vnthankefull that it maketh no recompence: ſo noyſome that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the body, which maketh ſinners ſpare, leſt they ſhould appeare to bee ſinners. Euery ſinne defileth a man, but drunkenneſſe maketh him like a beaſt: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne deſaceth a man, but drunkenneſſe taketh away the image of a man: euery ſinne robbeth a man of ſome vertue, but drunkenneſſe ſtealeth away all vertues at once: euery ſinne deſerueth puniſhment, but drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpbraides a man, while the wine is in the ſtomacke: and though hee would diſſemble his drunkenneſſe, yet hee is not able to ſet a countenance of it, but the childe deſcrieth him, the foole knowes that hee is drunke, becauſe his face betrayeth him, like the leproſie which braſt out of the forhead: ſo worthily hath hee loſt the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſobrietie, which hath loſt it ſelfe. His ſonne thinkes himſelfe more maiſter now then his father: his ſeruant makes him a foole: his children leade him like a childe: his wife vſeth him like a ſeruant, and although his drun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kenneſſe leaueth him when hee hath ſlept, yet no man ſeekes to him for counſell after, no man regards his word, no man reckons of his iudgement, no man is perſwaded by his counſell, no man accounts of his learning, no man hath any glory to accompany with him, but ſo ſoone as drunkenneſſe hath made him like a beaſt, euery man abhorreth him like a beaſt, as they did <hi>Nabuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar:</hi> the ſpirit flyeth from him leaſt it ſhould grieue it, his
<pb facs="tcp:25609:56"/> friendes goe away leaſt hee ſhould ſhame them, and no vertues dare come neere, leaſt he ſhould defile them.</p>
                     <p>How many things flie out when wine goes in? howe is it then that hee which loueth himſelfe, can bee ſo cruell to himſelfe, that hee ſhould loue his life, and ſhorten his life? that hee ſhould loue his health, and deſtroy his health? that he ſhould loue his ſtrength, and weaken his ſtrength? that he ſhould loue his wealth, and conſume his wealth? that he ſhould loue his credit, and cracke his credit? that he ſhould loue his vnderſtanding, and ouerturne his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? that he ſhould loue his beautie, and deforme his beautie? the Poets neede faining no more, that men are transformed into beaſtes, for if they were liuing now, they ſhould ſee men like beaſts: ſome like Lyons, ſome like wolues, ſome like Foxes, ſome like Beares, ſome like Swine: who is the beaſt when the beaſtes ſatisfie nature, and man ſatisfieth appetite? when the beaſts keepe meaſure and man exceedes meaſure? when the beaſts are found la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, and man found ſurfeiting, who is the beaſt? I haue read of a bird which hath the face of a man, but is ſo cruell of nature, that ſometime for hunger ſhee will ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man and ſlay him: after, when ſhee comes for thirſt vnto the water to drinke, ſeeing the face in the water like the face of him whome ſhee deuoured, for greife that ſhee had killed one like her ſelfe, takes ſuch ſorrow, that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eateth nor drinketh after, but beates, and frets, &amp; pines her ſelfe to death. What wilt thou doe then which haſt not ſlaine one like thy ſelfe, but thy ſelfe, thy very ſelfe with a cup of wine, and murdereſt ſo many vertues and graces in one houre?</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his land and liuing for a meſſe of pottage, ſo the drunkard ſelleth his ſenſe: and wit, and memorie, and credit for a cup of wine. Thou haſt not murthered thy brother like <hi>Caine,</hi> but thou haſt murthered thy ſelfe like <hi>Iudas:</hi> as the <hi>Rachabites</hi> abſtaining from wine, as <hi>Ionadab</hi> bad them, obtained the bleſſing which God had
<pb facs="tcp:25609:57"/> appointed to the Iſraelites: ſo let vs take heede, leaſt they which we account Idolaters, whileſt they faſt and watch, obtaine the bleſſing which God hath appointed for vs (get away the bleſſings) while wee ſit downe to eate, and riſe to play. Therefore, as Chriſt ſayd, remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, ſo I ſay, remember <hi>Let.</hi> one houre of drunkenneſſe did him more hurt, then all his enemies in <hi>Sodom:</hi> remember <hi>Noah</hi> one houre of drunkennes diſcouered that which was hid ſixe hundred yeares. Ten times more might be ſaid againſt this vice: but I haue ſaid enough to make you abhorre it, I haue had as much as I would.</p>
                     <p>Some goe about to excuſe <hi>Noah</hi> becauſe hee was an old man, and therefore might ſoone bee taken cupſhot: ſome becauſe the Wines were hotter in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, then they are with vs, ſome becauſe of his chaunge of drinkes, which had not woonted himſelfe to Wine before: ſome becauſe as moſt men delight in that which by great labour they haue brought to paſſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p>So no maruell though <hi>Noah</hi> had a longing to his owne grapes, following herein the example of a curious Cooke which doth ſup and ſup his broth, to taſte whether it bee well ſeaſoned, that hee may mend it if hee can, or mend the next: but as the Flie by often dallying with the candle, at laſt ſcorcheth her wings, with the flame, ſo taking, he was taken, and at laſt was drunke: yet this is imputed to him for his fault, that he was drunke, as the puniſhment which followes dooth witneſſe. Such is the prouidence of God, that his mercie might be glorified in all, hee hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all vnder ſinne, and ſuffered the beſt to fal, that no man might truſt in his owne ſtrength, and that wee ſeeing their repentance, may learne to riſe againe, howe greiuous ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our ſinnes bee. If wee haue beene Idolaters, if adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, if perſecutors, if murmurers, if murtherers, if blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, if drunkards: <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25609:57"/> and <hi>Noah,</hi> haue bin the like, who raigne now in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt with his Angels, and ſo may wee, if we re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent like them. Theſe examples, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our imitation, but for our admonition.</p>
                     <p>Thus you haue ſeene <hi>Noah</hi> ſober, and <hi>Noah</hi> drunken whereby wee may ſee that a man may bee drunke with his owne wine, hee may ſurfet with his owne meates, he may luſt with his owne wife, hee may offend with his own gifts his owne honour may make him proud, his owne riches may make him couetous, his owne ſtrength may make him venturous, his owne wit may make him contentious: therefore as the childe pluckes out the ſting before hee takes the honey: ſo let euery man, before hee receiues the gifts of God, ſit downe, and looke what baytes what ſnares, what temptations Sathan hath hid in them, and when he hath taken out the ſting, then eate the hony, and he ſhall vſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Chriſt, as Chriſt did himſelfe.</p>
